# Session 2025-12-01-01: mx CLI + cargo-binstall

## Completed

### mx CLI Refactor (Issue #46)
- Consolidated `encode-commit` into `commit --encode-only` flag
- Deprecated `encode-commit` (hidden, warns users)
- Fixed pre-push hook that was breaking on new branches (removed `git pull` from hook)
- PR #49 merged

### cargo-binstall Support
- Updated nebuchadnezzar release workflow:
  - Asset naming now uses full target triples (e.g., `mx-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`)
  - Release notes now include cargo install instructions and download table
- Added `[package.metadata.binstall]` to both base-d and mx Cargo.toml
- Created issue #1 on nebuchadnezzar to explore cargo-dist later

## Repos Modified
- `coryzibell/mx` - CLI refactor + binstall metadata
- `coryzibell/base-d` - binstall metadata
- `coryzibell/nebuchadnezzar` - Release workflow enhancements

## Next Release
Both mx and base-d will have:
- `cargo binstall` support out of the box
- Formatted release notes with platform download table
