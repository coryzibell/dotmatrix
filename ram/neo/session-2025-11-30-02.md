# Session Context - 2025-11-30 (02)

## Focus

dotmatrix infrastructure, base-d issue cleanup

## Completed This Session

### Programs
- Updated `/sync` - sequential session numbering (`session-{date}-{nn}.md`)
- Updated `/vase` - artifacts only rule (no zion writes, compress handles promotion)

### Agents
- Created `sentinel.md` - atomic haiku worker for swarm parallelism
- Updated `orchestration.md` with Sentinel in dispatch table and rules

### Zion
- Updated projects database via Zion Control
- Removed stale entries (testproj, beads, matrix)
- Added missing projects (gifclip, rust-template, speedo)
- Updated base-d and dotmatrix with paths/repos

### base-d
- Verified R7 SIMD LUT refactoring is complete
- Closed issues #89-93 (all 5 phases done)
- Current structure: common.rs, base16.rs, base32.rs, base64.rs, gapped.rs
- 13 open issues remain

### mx
- Created issue #45: `mx run` - npx-style crate runner

## Key Decisions

- Sentinel vs Kid: Kid runs commands, Sentinel transforms content (stateless swarm)
- Vase outputs stay in artifacts/, compress promotes to zion later
- Session files use sequential numbering for multiple sessions per day

## No blockers
