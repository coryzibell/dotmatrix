# Session: 2025-11-28

## Work Completed

### mx CLI
- Added dejavu detection to `mx commit` - observes when both title and body randomly get same dictionary
- Fixed `encode_hash` to properly write to stdin
- CI workflow fix: use `GH_PAT` for release creation so knock-knock triggers for crates.io publish
- Installed mx v0.1.7 to cargo bin (not yet on crates.io)

### dotmatrix
- Created `lib/mx.md` - how to find mx
- Created `lib/mx-commit.md` - encoded commit execution details
- Updated `upload.md` and `hardline.md` to reference libs
- Added "Finding Tools" section to CLAUDE.md (PATH, mise, common locations, source)
- Updated `_base.md` agent instructions:
  - Storage tiers table (RAM read/write, Cache read/write, Zion read-only)
  - Knowledge flow: static knowledge → Zion Control, decisions → Neo
- Updated `zion-control.md` with `mx zion` CLI reference (not mx commit - that's Kid's domain)
- Updated `operator.md` - step 2 now loads libraries (required reading)
- Updated `locate.md` - "when in doubt, ask"
- Updated `hardline.md` - "run autonomously, only ask if blocked"

### rust-template
- Fixed release workflow to use `GH_PAT` for crates.io publish trigger

## Key Clarifications
- `mx zion` → Zion Control's domain (knowledge management)
- `mx commit` → Kid executes (encoded commits in programs)
- Agents use RAM/cache for session stuff
- Static knowledge questions → Zion Control first, then Neo
- Decisions → Neo (who may escalate to kautau)
- Zion Control retrieves and stores. Neo decides.

## Pending
- mx not yet on crates.io (waiting for next release cycle to trigger knock-knock)
- Once published: `mise use -g cargo:mx@latest`
