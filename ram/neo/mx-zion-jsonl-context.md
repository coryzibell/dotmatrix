# mx zion JSONL Context

**Date:** 2025-11-28
**Context:** Reviewing whether to keep JSONL index file

## Current State

- `~/.matrix/zion/index.jsonl` - JSONL backup of knowledge entries
- Generated by `mx zion rebuild` (markdown → db → jsonl)
- Can be imported via `mx zion import`

## The Question

Now that we're database-first with `mx zion add`, is JSONL still needed?

## Options Identified

1. **Keep JSONL as export format** - useful for backup, portability, grep-ability
2. **Remove JSONL entirely** - SQLite is the only truth
3. **Make export explicit** - `mx zion export` instead of auto-generating on rebuild

## Pending

- Architect auditing https://github.com/steveyegge/beads (mx zion was based on this)
- Combine audit findings with this question
- Pass to Zion Control to determine best path forward
