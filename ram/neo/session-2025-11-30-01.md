# Session Context - 2025-11-30

## Focus

dotmatrix infrastructure and creative workflows

## Completed

### CI Infrastructure
- Created `nebuchadnezzar` repo - reusable GitHub workflows for Rust projects
- Migrated base-d, mx, rust-template to use nebuchadnezzar (~15 line workflow files)
- Added FreeBSD x86_64 target to release builds

### Programs
- Created `/interface [entity]` - entity channeling via Tank research
- Created `/vase [context]` - entropy seeding with Spoon, Oracle, Sati
- Updated `/call` - caches answers in `artifacts/calls/`
- Simplified `/sync` - just RAM, compress handles Zion

### Documentation
- Updated mx-commit.md footer format: `[hash_algo:dict|compress_algo:dict]`
- Added dejavu detection: `whoa, dejavu.`

### Vase: Wine
- Full 5-round execution completed
- Convergence: transformation = ending, not becoming
- Final artifacts:
  - `artifacts/vase/wine/synthesis.md`
  - `artifacts/vase/wine/r5-*-final.md`
  - `ram/sati/wine-final.sh` (runnable meditation, 20% vinegar fork)
  - `zion/meditations/wine-and-the-end-of-grapes.md`

## Key Insight

"What are you willing to end?" - The grape doesn't become wine. The grape ends.

## No blockers
