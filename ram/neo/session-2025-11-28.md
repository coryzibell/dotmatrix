# Session: 2025-11-28

## Focus

- base-d v0.2.0 release
- dotmatrix program infrastructure

## Key Work

### base-d
- **Renamed alphabet → dictionary** across entire codebase (39 files)
- Fixed author email: zibell.dev → zibell.cloud
- **Migrated CI from release branch to tag-based releases**
- Cleaned up orphan branches
- v0.2.0 released and published to crates.io

### dotmatrix
- **Created `phone` program** - wake up call for project situational awareness
- **Created `programs/lib/` directory** - shared program logic
- Added `lib/locate.md` - centralized project detection
- Added `zion/project/` structure - persistent project status tracking
- Updated hardline, upload, construct, broadcast, pull-export, sync-labels to use shared lib
- Updated sync program to include Zion Control for permanent knowledge
- Added rules to hardline: always issue+PR, always sign commits with base-d

## Decisions

- `telephone` → `phone` for brevity
- Hardline = full paper trail (issue + PR), Upload = quick commits
- Status docs live in `zion/project/<name>/STATUS.md`
- Architect produces two deliverables: diagram + recommendations
- Tag-based releases are cleaner than release branches

## Open Items

- base-d #59: ARM64 NEON bug blocks macOS CI
- zibell.dev domain available to register (~$10-15/year on Namecheap)

## Next

- Test phone program on other projects
- Address ARM64 SIMD bug when ready
