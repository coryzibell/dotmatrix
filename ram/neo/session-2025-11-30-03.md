# Session Context - 2025-11-30 (03)

## Focus

base-d deep dive: dictionaries, SIMD architecture, documentation

## Completed This Session

### Dictionaries
- Added bioctal dictionary (RFC 9226) - cognitive-optimized hex
- Full string: `01234567cjzwfsbv`
- Uses SIMD via SmallLutCodec (arbitrary base16)

### Documentation
- Created `docs/SIMD_BINARY.md` - why binary SIMD isn't worth it
- Updated `docs/DICTIONARIES.md` with bioctal

### SIMD Architecture Analysis
- Identified two SIMD patterns:
  - `x86_64/specialized/` - hardcoded RFC dictionaries (x86 only)
  - `lut/` - arbitrary dictionaries (x86 + ARM inline)
- ARM lacks specialized implementations, uses LUT fallback

### Issues Filed
- #109 - ARM NEON specialized implementations
- #110 - Comprehensive SIMD benchmarking (scalar vs LUT vs specialized)

## Next Up

- SIMD benchmarking on x86 (this machine)
- ARM specialized work running in parallel on Mac

## Key Insight

SIMD dispatch flow:
1. Check for specialized path (RFC dictionaries)
2. Fall back to LUT codec (arbitrary dictionaries)
3. Fall back to scalar

ARM skips step 1 entirely - opportunity for optimization.
