# Session 2025-12-02-01

## Focus
base-d debugging and exploration

## Key Events

### Issue #125: Garbled commit messages
- Investigated commit ddca787 with C1 control characters in title
- Footer showed `[keccak224:|brotli:base45]` - empty dictionary after hash algo
- Raw bytes were UTF-8 encoded U+0080-U+009F (C1 control range)
- These would require `start_codepoint = 0x80` but no dictionary has that
- Created issue to track - intermittent, can't reproduce locally

### Issue #126: Schema-aware encoding exploration
- Inspired by TOON format (20k stars) - structural compression for LLMs
- TOON: ~40% token reduction by eliminating repeated JSON keys/syntax
- Brainstorm: Could base-d have schema-aware mode?
  - Readable schema header + encoded values
  - `users[3]{id,name,role}:` with base-d encoded rows
  - LLM sees structure, data stays compact
- Pure exploration, may be crazy

## Open Questions
- What causes the C1 control character bug? Dictionary selection? Encoding path?
- Is schema-aware encoding base-d's job or a separate tool?

## Repos Touched
- base-d: issues created, investigation only
- dotmatrix: this session note
