# Command Ideas

## Naming Concepts

Explored names for the "OS" that loads before programs:
- **os.md** - Direct, obvious
- **kernel.md** - The core that runs everything
- **mainframe.md** - Matrix-y, where programs run
- **operator.md** - Tank's station, where programs get loaded from ✓ CHOSEN
- **source.md** - "The function of the One is to return to the Source"

**Decision:** `operator.md` - it's Tank's role, and `/load` is literally what an operator does.

## Future Command Ideas

- `/jack` - Jack into a project (load project-specific context from `.matrix/`)
- `/unplug` - Clean exit, save session state to RAM
- `/training` - Like the dojo - practice/sandbox mode?
- `/construct` - Could be shorthand for `/load construct`
- `/broadcast` - Shorthand for `/load broadcast`
- `/phone` - "Find an exit" - wrap up current work, commit, summarize

## Program Ideas

- **dojo.md** - Training/practice environment
- **upgrade.md** - Self-improvement, update matrix config based on learnings
- **trace.md** - "Trace the call" - deep debugging workflow
