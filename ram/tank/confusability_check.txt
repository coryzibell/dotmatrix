CONFUSABILITY CHECK - Circle variants vs ASCII O and digit 0
================================================================================

ASCII Letter O (U+004F):     O O O O O O O O O O
ASCII Digit 0 (U+0030):      0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
U+25CB White Circle:         ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○  [EXCLUDED]
U+25EF Large Circle:         ◯ ◯ ◯ ◯ ◯ ◯ ◯ ◯ ◯ ◯  [INCLUDED]

Side by side test:
O0○◯ O0○◯ O0○◯ O0○◯ O0○◯ O0○◯ O0○◯ O0○◯

Mixed strings:
O◯O0O○O◯O0O○O◯O0O○O◯O0
0○0◯0O0○0◯0O0○0◯0O0○

Key differences:
- O (letter): Slightly oval in most fonts
- 0 (digit): Often has slash or dot, clearly numeric
- ○ (U+25CB): Very similar to O, CRITICAL CONFUSABLE [EXCLUDED]
- ◯ (U+25EF): Larger, bolder stroke, more distinct [KEPT]

VERDICT: U+25EF is visually distinct enough to keep.

================================================================================
SQUARE CONFUSABILITY CHECK - vs space/empty
================================================================================

Space character:             [   ] [   ] [   ] [   ] [   ]
U+25A1 White Square:         [ □ ] [ □ ] [ □ ] [ □ ] [ □ ]  [EXCLUDED]
U+25A0 Black Square:         [ ■ ] [ ■ ] [ ■ ] [ ■ ] [ ■ ]  [INCLUDED]

The white square □ can easily be mistaken for empty space or an input box.
Black square ■ is clearly visible and distinct.

VERDICT: Correctly excluded U+25A1, kept U+25A0.

BOX DRAWING - Light vs Heavy comparison
================================================================================

Light horizontal (U+2500):   ──────────  [EXCLUDED - too thin]
Heavy horizontal (U+2501):   ━━━━━━━━━━  [INCLUDED - clear]

Light vertical (U+2502):     │││││││││  [EXCLUDED - too thin]
Heavy vertical (U+2503):     ┃┃┃┃┃┃┃┃┃  [INCLUDED - clear]

Light corner (U+250C):       ┌  [EXCLUDED]
Heavy corner (U+250F):       ┏  [INCLUDED]

Light box:                   ┌─────┐  [EXCLUDED - nearly invisible]
                             │     │
                             └─────┘

Heavy box:                   ┏━━━━━┓  [INCLUDED - clearly visible]
                             ┃     ┃
                             ┗━━━━━┛

VERDICT: Light variants correctly excluded.

================================================================================
BLOCK ELEMENTS - Partial vs Full
================================================================================

Full block (U+2588):         █ █ █ █ █  [INCLUDED]

Half blocks:
Upper half (U+2580):         ▀ ▀ ▀ ▀ ▀  [EXCLUDED - orientation unclear]
Lower half (U+2584):         ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄  [EXCLUDED - orientation unclear]
Left half (U+258C):          ▌ ▌ ▌ ▌ ▌  [EXCLUDED - orientation unclear]
Right half (U+2590):         ▐ ▐ ▐ ▐ ▐  [EXCLUDED - orientation unclear]

Quadrants (distinct patterns):
Lower left (U+2596):         ▖ ▖ ▖ ▖ ▖  [INCLUDED - unique pattern]
Lower right (U+2597):        ▗ ▗ ▗ ▗ ▗  [INCLUDED - unique pattern]
Upper left (U+2598):         ▘ ▘ ▘ ▘ ▘  [INCLUDED - unique pattern]
Upper right (U+259D):        ▝ ▝ ▝ ▝ ▝  [INCLUDED - unique pattern]

Shades (confusable progression):
Light shade (U+2591):        ░ ░ ░ ░ ░  [EXCLUDED - looks similar]
Medium shade (U+2592):       ▒ ▒ ▒ ▒ ▒  [EXCLUDED - looks similar]
Dark shade (U+2593):         ▓ ▓ ▓ ▓ ▓  [EXCLUDED - looks similar]

VERDICT: Full and quadrants kept, half-fills and shades correctly excluded.

================================================================================
FINAL CONFUSABILITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

✓ No characters confusable with ASCII letters
✓ No characters confusable with ASCII digits
✓ No characters that look like whitespace
✓ No pairs that are indistinguishable from each other
✓ All characters visible at small sizes
✓ All characters have distinct, recognizable shapes

Safe to use: 102 characters (or 96 if excluding heavy dashed variants)
