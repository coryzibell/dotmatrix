## Knowledge

**J** is the only letter that doesn't appear in any element name on the periodic table.

- X appears in Xenon
- Q appears in temporary element names (like Ununquadium) before permanent naming
- Every other letter shows up at least once

## Why It Matters

- Good companion to the "Q doesn't appear in US state names" trivia
- Latin-based scientific naming conventions tend to avoid J (which evolved from I)
- J is also relatively rare in English overall
