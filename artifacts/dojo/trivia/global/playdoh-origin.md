## Knowledge

Play-Doh was originally marketed as a wallpaper cleaner in the 1930s, designed to clean coal soot off walls. When natural gas replaced coal heating (producing less soot), sales tanked.

A nursery school teacher noticed kids loved playing with it, and by 1956 it was rebranded as a toy.

## Why It Matters

- Classic example of pivoting a failing product
- Similar origin stories: Slinky (tension spring that fell off shelf), bubble wrap (failed wallpaper)
- The original formula was non-toxic, which made the toy transition possible
