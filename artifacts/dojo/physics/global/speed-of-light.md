# Speed of Light

**Topic:** physics
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

The speed of light in a vacuum is **299,792 km/s** (~300,000 km/s rounded).

Other useful forms:
- ~186,000 miles/s
- ~1 foot per nanosecond (useful for hardware latency)
- Exactly 299,792,458 m/s (the meter is now defined by this)

Derivation: c = light-year / year = 9.46 trillion km / 31.5 million seconds

## Why It Matters

- Universal speed limit - nothing with mass can reach it
- E = mc² shows tiny mass = enormous energy
- In networking/hardware, light in fiber travels ~0.67c due to refractive index
- 1 foot/ns is why CPUs care about physical distance

## Quiz Question

What's the speed of light in a vacuum, rounded to the nearest thousand km/s?

## Answer

300,000 km/s (exactly 299,792 km/s).
