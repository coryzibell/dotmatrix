# Black Box Color

**Topic:** aviation
**Scope:** global

## Knowledge

Aircraft "black boxes" (flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders) are actually painted bright orange, not black. The name "black box" likely comes from early prototype units that were indeed black, or from the term's use in engineering to describe a system whose internal workings are opaque.

The bright orange color (officially "international orange") is chosen specifically to make them easier to find in wreckage. They also have reflective tape and an underwater locator beacon (ULB) that emits a 37.5 kHz pulse for 30+ days when submerged.

## Why It Matters

- Common misconception with practical reasoning behind the truth
- The orange color + beacon have helped recover crucial evidence from crashes
- The ULB frequency (37.5 kHz) is specifically chosen to be detectable by sonar
