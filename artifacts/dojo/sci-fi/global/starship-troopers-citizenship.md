# Starship Troopers - Citizenship

**Topic:** sci-fi
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

In Robert Heinlein's *Starship Troopers* (1959), full citizenship with voting rights requires completion of **Federal Service** - typically military service, though any dangerous government work qualifies.

Only veterans can vote or hold public office. The philosophy: citizenship must be earned through personal sacrifice and demonstrated willingness to prioritize society over self.

**Book vs. Movie:** Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film satirized this as fascism (he intentionally didn't read the book). Heinlein intended it as serious political philosophy about civic responsibility - controversial but not meant as satire.

The novel is more philosophical than action-focused, spending significant time on Rico's training and moral education.
