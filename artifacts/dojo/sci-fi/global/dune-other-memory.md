**Other Memory** is the Bene Gesserit ability to access the memories of all female ancestors through genetic memory.

Reverend Mothers gain this ability through the **spice agony** - a near-death experience triggered by consuming an awareness spectrum narcotic (the Water of Life). They can only access their female lineage.

The **Kwisatz Haderach** was the Bene Gesserit's breeding program goal - a male who could access both male and female genetic memory, seeing "where they cannot look." Paul Atreides becomes this figure.
