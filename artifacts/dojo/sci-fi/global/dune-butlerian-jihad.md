# Dune - Butlerian Jihad

**Topic:** sci-fi
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

The **Butlerian Jihad** was a crusade against thinking machines/AI that occurred approximately 10,000 years before the events of *Dune*.

It established the lasting prohibition: **"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind."**

This single prohibition shaped the entire Dune universe:
- **Mentats** - humans trained as "human computers" for logic and calculation
- **Spacing Guild** - navigators who use spice to prescently calculate safe hyperspace routes
- **Bene Gesserit** - developed human potential through breeding programs and mental/physical training

The lack of computers explains why the feudal political structure persists 20,000+ years in the future - human potential was maximized instead of technological advancement.
