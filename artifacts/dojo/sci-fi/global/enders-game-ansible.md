# Ender's Game - The Ansible

**Topic:** sci-fi
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

The **ansible** in *Ender's Game* is an **instantaneous communication device** - allowing real-time communication across any distance with zero delay.

It violates the **speed of light limitation** from special relativity. Nothing can transmit information faster than light; doing so would break causality (you could receive messages before they were sent).

The ansible is critical to the plot - it's how Ender commands the fleet in real-time during the "simulations" that turn out to be actual battles occurring light-years away.

**Etymology:** Orson Scott Card borrowed the term from **Ursula K. Le Guin**, who coined it in *Rocannon's World* (1966). The word may derive from "answerable."

## Quiz Question

In Ender's Game, what is the ansible, and what physics concept does it violate?

## Answer

An instantaneous communication device that violates the speed of light limitation (faster-than-light information transfer).
