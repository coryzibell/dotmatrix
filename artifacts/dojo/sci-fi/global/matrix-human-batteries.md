# The Matrix - Human Batteries

**Topic:** sci-fi
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

In *The Matrix*, humans **scorched the sky** (Operation Dark Storm) to cut off the machines' solar power during the war. In response, the machines began using humans as an energy source - harvesting bioelectric and thermal energy from human bodies "combined with a form of fusion."

**Behind the scenes:** The Wachowskis originally intended humans to be used for **processing power** - the machines needed human brains as a distributed computing network. The studio thought audiences wouldn't understand this concept, so it was changed to the simpler (but scientifically absurd) "batteries" explanation.

In reality, humans consume far more energy than they produce - we'd be terrible batteries. The processing power concept made more sense.

## Quiz Question

In The Matrix, why do the machines keep humans alive in pods rather than using another power source?

## Answer

Humans scorched the sky to block solar power, so machines use humans as batteries (bioelectric/thermal energy combined with fusion).
