**The Sprawl** in William Gibson's *Neuromancer* is the **Boston-Atlanta Metropolitan Axis (BAMA)** - a massive urban megalopolis stretching down the entire US East Coast.

It represents the ultimate urban sprawl: cities merged into one continuous corridor of decay, neon, and corporate control.

**Chiba City** (Japan) is a separate location - a lawless zone where Case goes to get his damaged nervous system repaired so he can jack into cyberspace again. Chiba is known for black market surgeons and tech modifications.

Gibson coined the term "cyberspace" in this novel (1984), predating the mainstream internet.
