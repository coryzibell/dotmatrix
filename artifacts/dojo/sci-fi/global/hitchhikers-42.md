# Hitchhiker's Guide - 42

**Topic:** sci-fi
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

**42** is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything in Douglas Adams' *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*.

The supercomputer **Deep Thought** took 7.5 million years to compute it. The problem: no one knew what the actual Question was.

So they built an even larger computer - **Earth** - to find the Question. It was destroyed by Vogons five minutes before completing its 10-million-year program to make way for a hyperspace bypass.

The Question may have been "What do you get when you multiply six by nine?" (which equals 42 in base 13). Douglas Adams claimed this was coincidence.
