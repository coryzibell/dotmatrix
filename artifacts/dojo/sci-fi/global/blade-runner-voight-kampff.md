# Blade Runner - Voight-Kampff Test

**Topic:** sci-fi
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

The **Voight-Kampff test** in *Blade Runner* detects replicants by measuring empathic responses to emotionally provocative questions.

The machine primarily monitors **pupil dilation and iris fluctuation** using a bellows-like device aimed at the subject's eye. It measures involuntary iris contraction and capillary dilation.

The theory: emotional responses manifest physically in the eye before conscious thought can mask them. Replicants lack genuine empathy, so their pupil reactions are delayed or absent.

The test's questions involve hypothetical scenarios designed to provoke emotional responses - often involving animals, which are rare in the dystopian future.

## Quiz Question

In Blade Runner, what specific physiological response does the Voight-Kampff machine primarily monitor?

## Answer

Pupil dilation and iris fluctuation (eye responses).
