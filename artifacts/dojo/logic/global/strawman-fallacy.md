# Strawman Fallacy

**Topic:** logic
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

The **strawman fallacy** is when someone attacks a weakened or misrepresented version of an opponent's argument instead of the actual argument.

Example:
- Person A: "We should have more regulations on industrial pollution."
- Person B: "So you want to shut down all businesses and destroy the economy?"

The opposite practice is **steelmanning** - constructing the *strongest* possible version of your opponent's argument before addressing it.

## Why It Matters

- One of the most common logical fallacies in debates and online arguments
- Often unintentional - people genuinely misunderstand opposing views
- Recognizing it helps you argue more honestly and persuasively
- Steelmanning builds credibility and often leads to better understanding
