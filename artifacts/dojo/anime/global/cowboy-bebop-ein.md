## Knowledge

**Ein** is the genetically engineered Welsh Corgi in *Cowboy Bebop* (1998). He was a "data dog" - a product of illegal genetic experimentation that gave him **enhanced human-level intelligence**.

Ein can:
- Hack computers
- Understand human speech
- Play shogi (Japanese chess)
- Answer phones
- Drive vehicles

The Bebop crew (Spike, Jet, Faye) never fully realized how intelligent Ein was. He eventually leaves with Ed (the hacker girl) at the end of the series.

Ein was originally a lab animal who escaped. His intelligence makes him essentially a crew member, not just a pet.
