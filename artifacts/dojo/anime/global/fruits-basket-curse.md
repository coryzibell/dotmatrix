In *Fruits Basket* (2001, remade 2019), members of the Sohma family are cursed to **transform into animals of the Chinese zodiac** when hugged by someone of the opposite sex (or under extreme stress).

Thirteen family members carry the curse - the twelve zodiac animals plus the cat (who was tricked out of the zodiac in legend). They transform back to human form after a short time... but naked, causing awkward situations.

- Yuki - Rat
- Kyo - Cat (outcast, not officially zodiac)
- Shigure - Dog
- Kagura - Boar
- Momiji - Rabbit

Tohru Honda, an orphaned girl living with the Sohmas, learns their secret and helps them deal with the emotional trauma the curse causes.
