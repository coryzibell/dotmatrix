## Knowledge

**Hitokiri Battousai** was Kenshin Himura's title during the Bakumatsu war (1853-1867).

- **Hitokiri** = "manslayer" - a title given to elite assassins
- **Battousai** = "master of battou-jutsu" - the quick-draw sword technique

During the Bakumatsu (civil war ending the Tokugawa shogunate), Kenshin was a feared assassin for the Ishin Shishi revolutionaries working to restore the Emperor. His legendary speed made him nearly mythical - targets died before seeing him draw.

After the new Meiji era began, Kenshin swore a vow never to kill again. He carries a **sakabatou** (reverse-blade sword) with the sharp edge on the inside curve, so he can fight without killing.

The series (1996) explores his attempt to atone for his past while protecting people in the new era.
