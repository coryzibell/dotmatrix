## Knowledge

In *FLCL* (Fooly Cooly, 2000), **robots** emerge from protagonist Naota's forehead throughout the series. His head becomes an "N.O. channel" - a dimensional portal.

**Medical Mechanica** is the sinister organization/corporation Haruko is connected to and searching for. Their factory (shaped like a giant steam iron) literally wants to "iron out" everyone's brains - flattening thoughts into conformity.

Haruko's true goal is finding **Atomsk**, the "Pirate King" - the most powerful N.O. being in the galaxy. Medical Mechanica captured him, and Haruko wants his power.

The 6-episode OVA is famously surreal, using puberty/adolescence as metaphor while throwing robots, Vespas, and electric guitars at the viewer.

Created by Gainax (Evangelion studio), directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki.
