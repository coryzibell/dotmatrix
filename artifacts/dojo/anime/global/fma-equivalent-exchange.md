# Fullmetal Alchemist - Equivalent Exchange

**Topic:** anime
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

The **Law of Equivalent Exchange** in *Fullmetal Alchemist* (2003/2009): "To obtain something, something of equal value must be lost."

This is the fundamental law of alchemy in the series.

**Human transmutation** (attempting to resurrect the dead) is the ultimate taboo. When Edward and Alphonse Elric tried to bring back their dead mother:

- **Edward** lost his left leg initially, then sacrificed his right arm to bind Al's soul
- **Alphonse** lost his **entire physical body** - only his soul remained, bound to a suit of armor

The cruel irony: they failed. What they created was a twisted, malformed thing that died immediately. They paid an enormous toll and got nothing in return.

The series follows their quest to find the Philosopher's Stone - which can bypass Equivalent Exchange - to restore their bodies.
