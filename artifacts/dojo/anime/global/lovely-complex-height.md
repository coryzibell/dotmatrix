# Lovely Complex - The Height Difference

**Topic:** anime (shoujo)
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

In *Lovely Complex* (2007), the central comedic/romantic premise is the **reversed height difference**:

- **Risa Koizumi** - 172cm (5'8") - tall for a Japanese girl
- **Atsushi Otani** - 156cm (5'1") - short for a Japanese boy

This reverses typical couple expectations in Japan, where boyfriends are "supposed" to be taller. They're nicknamed **"All Hanshin-Kyojin"** after a famous Japanese comedy duo with the same height dynamic.

**The conflict:** Both are insecure about their heights:
- Risa wants a tall boyfriend she can look up to
- Otani wants a shorter girlfriend he can protect

But they keep falling for each other despite fighting it. The series balances comedy about their height gags with genuine exploration of their insecurities and growing feelings.

"Lovely Complex" = "Love Com" = wordplay on their height "complex."
