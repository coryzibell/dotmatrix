## Knowledge

In *Peach Girl* (2005), Momo Adachi's main problem is her **tan skin and bleached hair** from being on the swim team (chlorine lightens hair, sun darkens skin).

In Japan, this "ganguro" or gyaru look is stereotypically associated with party girls and promiscuity. Momo is actually innocent and kind, but people constantly assume she's "easy" based on her appearance.

**The antagonist:** Her "best friend" **Sae** is a manipulative social climber who exploits these rumors, spreads lies, and systematically steals Momo's love interests. Sae appears sweet to others but is calculating and cruel.

The series deals with:
- Judging people by appearance
- Toxic friendships and manipulation
- Love triangles (Momo, Toji, Kairi)
- Reputation and rumors in school

Created by Miwa Ueda.
