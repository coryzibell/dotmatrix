## Knowledge

In *Skip Beat!* (2008), Kyoko Mogami enters show business for **revenge** against her childhood friend **Sho Fuwa**.

**The backstory:** Kyoko devoted herself entirely to supporting Sho's dream of becoming a pop star - working multiple jobs, cooking, cleaning, basically being his servant. Once he became famous, he dumped her, calling her "boring" and "plain." She overhears him mocking her to another woman.

This triggers her transformation from doormat to revenge-driven actress.

**The grudge demons:** When Kyoko is angry or plotting revenge, **little dark demon spirits** emerge from her - chibi versions of herself that float around representing her dark emotions. They're a signature visual gag in the series.

Ironically, Kyoko discovers genuine talent and passion for acting along the way, and her revenge motivation evolves into something more complex.
