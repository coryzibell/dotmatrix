**Topic:** anime

## Knowledge

In *Ghost in the Shell* (1995), Major Motoko Kusanagi questions **whether she still has a "ghost" (soul/consciousness)** or if she's just sophisticated programming that believes it has one.

Her situation:
- Organic brain (maybe - she's not even certain of this)
- Fully synthetic cyborg body
- Memories that could be real or implanted

**The philosophical questions:**
- Is her sense of self genuine consciousness or programming?
- Are her memories authentic or manufactured?
- Could she have been an AI all along, just believing she was once human?
- What makes someone "human" when the body is artificial?

The film's title IS the central question: Does the shell (synthetic body) contain a ghost (soul), or is the "ghost" just an emergent illusion of complex systems?

This predates and influenced The Matrix (1999), exploring similar themes of identity, reality, and consciousness in a cyberpunk future.
