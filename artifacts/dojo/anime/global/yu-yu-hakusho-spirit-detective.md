## Knowledge

In *Yu Yu Hakusho* (1992-1995), Yusuke Urameshi becomes a **Spirit Detective** (Reikai Tantei) after being resurrected.

**The setup:** Yusuke, a 14-year-old delinquent, dies unexpectedly saving a child from being hit by a car. His sacrifice wasn't "scheduled" - Spirit World didn't expect him to do something selfless. Koenma (the toddler-form son of King Enma, ruler of Spirit World) gives Yusuke a chance to return to life.

The catch: Yusuke must work as Spirit World's detective in the human realm, investigating demons, supernatural crimes, and threats to humanity.

Created by Yoshihiro Togashi (who later made Hunter x Hunter).
