## Knowledge

In *Ouran High School Host Club*, Honey-senpai (Mitsukuni Haninozuka) is the **"Loli-shota" type** - the cute, childlike host.

**The contradiction:**
- He's 17 years old, a third-year student, the OLDEST in the club
- Looks like an elementary schooler
- Acts adorably childish - loves cake, carries stuffed bunny "Usa-chan"
- Actually a martial arts MASTER from an elite fighting family
- Could easily destroy anyone in the club

**Host Club types:**
- Tamaki - Prince/King type
- Kyoya - Cool type
- Hikaru & Kaoru - Little Devil type (twins)
- Mori - Wild/Strong & Silent type
- Honey - Loli-shota/Boy Lolita type
- Haruhi - Natural type

The gap moe between Honey's cute appearance and his deadly martial arts skills is a running joke.
