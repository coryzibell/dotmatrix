## Knowledge

In *Akira* (1988), **Akira** is a child (Number 28) with godlike psychic powers whose awakening destroyed Tokyo in 1988, triggering World War III.

After the disaster, Akira was kept in a **cryogenic vault deep beneath the Olympic stadium** in Neo-Tokyo. He's frozen and disassembled into components - the government couldn't kill him and couldn't control him, so they put him on ice.

The story follows Tetsuo, a teenage biker gang member who develops similar psychic powers after a motorcycle accident involving an escaped test subject. Tetsuo's growing abilities eventually draw him to Akira's vault, seeking that power.

The film (and manga by Katsuhiro Otomo) is considered one of the most influential anime ever made, introducing many Western audiences to anime as a serious medium.
