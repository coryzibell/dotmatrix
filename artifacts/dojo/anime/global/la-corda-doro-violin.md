## Knowledge

In *La Corda d'Oro* (Kin'iro no Corda, 2006), Kahoko Hino receives a magical **violin** from a music fairy named Lili.

**The setup:**
- Kahoko is a regular student at Seiso Academy (which has both general and elite music departments)
- Lili gives her a magic violin that plays beautifully as long as she truly wants to play
- She's entered into a prestigious music competition against actual prodigies
- The magic fades if she doesn't develop real skill and passion

**The twist:** She must learn to play for real, as relying solely on magic won't work forever. The series follows her growth as a musician and her relationships with the male musicians (reverse harem).

Based on a Koei otome game (same company that makes Dynasty Warriors). Features classical music throughout.
