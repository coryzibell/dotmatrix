# Inuyasha - Kagome's Ability

**Topic:** anime (shoujo/action)
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

In *Inuyasha* (2000-2004), Kagome Higurashi's special ability is that she can **see and sense Shikon Jewel shards**.

**Why she has this power:**
- She's the reincarnation of the priestess Kikyo
- This gives her latent spiritual/purification powers
- She can see shards glowing even when embedded in demons

**Why it matters:**
- The Shikon Jewel shattered into hundreds of shards
- Demons and villains seek shards for power
- Without Kagome, finding shards would be nearly impossible
- This makes her both valuable and a target for kidnapping

She also develops archery skills with sacred arrows (like Kikyo), but her shard-sensing is her unique contribution to the group.

Created by Rumiko Takahashi (also created Ranma ½ and Urusei Yatsura).
