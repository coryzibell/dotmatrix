# Itazura na Kiss - Lifespan Romance

**Topic:** anime (shoujo)
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

*Itazura na Kiss* (1996 anime, 1990 manga) is unique because the romance spans **from high school through adulthood** - far longer than typical shoujo:

**Stages covered:**
- High school (initial rejection and pursuit)
- College/university
- Marriage
- Careers (she becomes a nurse, he becomes a doctor)
- Parenthood

Most shoujo ends when the couple gets together or at graduation. This series shows the "happily ever after" - the struggles of marriage, career challenges, and raising children.

**Tragic note:** Creator Kaoru Tada died in 1999 before completing the manga. The story has been adapted numerous times across Asia (Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, Thai versions) due to its enduring popularity.

The dynamic: Kotoko is an average, clumsy girl persistently pursuing Naoki, a cold genius who gradually warms to her over years.
