## Knowledge

In *Nana* (2006), the two protagonists (both named Nana) share several symbolic bonds:

**Room 707** - They become roommates in apartment 707. "Nana" means "seven" in Japanese, so 707 represents both of them.

**Strawberry glasses** - They drink from matching strawberry-shaped glasses, which become a symbol of their friendship and their promise to stay together.

**Lotus flower tattoo** - Nana Osaki has a lotus tattoo, and Nana Komatsu ("Hachi") eventually gets a matching one as a symbol of their bond.

The series (by Ai Yazawa) follows two very different women - punk rock singer Nana Osaki and bubbly romantic Nana "Hachi" Komatsu - who meet on a train to Tokyo and become inseparable friends despite their contrasting personalities.

The anime/manga is considered josei (aimed at adult women) for its mature, realistic portrayal of relationships, ambition, and heartbreak.
