**Topic:** anime (shoujo)
**Scope:** global

## Knowledge

In *Marmalade Boy* (1994-1995), the unusual living arrangement: **both sets of parents swap spouses and all six people move in together**.

- Miki's mother marries Yuu's father
- Miki's father marries Yuu's mother
- All six live in one house

This makes Miki and Yuu **step-siblings**, creating a taboo feeling around their budding romance. They live together, see each other constantly, and have to navigate attraction while being "family."

**The twist:** Later the series suggests they might be biological half-siblings (one parent may have had an affair). This creates major angst. Spoiler: they're ultimately not blood-related, but the uncertainty torments them for a while.

The title "Marmalade Boy" refers to Yuu's personality - sweet but with a bitter edge, like marmalade.

Created by Wataru Yoshizumi.
