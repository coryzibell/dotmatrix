In *Outlaw Star* (1998), **Melfina** is a bio-android that Gene Starwind finds in a suitcase. She's the key to finding the **Galactic Leyline** - a legendary location said to grant ultimate knowledge, power, or wishes.

Melfina was created specifically to:
- Interface with the Outlaw Star's navigation system (she sits in a cylindrical chamber on the bridge)
- Unlock and navigate to the Galactic Leyline

She has no memories of her creation or purpose, spending the series discovering who/what she is while Gene and his crew race pirates, the Kei Guild, and assassins to reach the Leyline first.

The show aired on Toonami alongside Cowboy Bebop and shared a similar space western vibe, though more action-adventure focused.
