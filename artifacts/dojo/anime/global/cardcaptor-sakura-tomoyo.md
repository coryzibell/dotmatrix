## Knowledge

In *Cardcaptor Sakura*, **Tomoyo Daidouji** is Sakura's best friend who films all of her magical adventures.

**Tomoyo's role:**
- Records all card captures with her video camera
- Designs and sews elaborate battle costumes for Sakura
- Comes from an extremely wealthy family (her mother runs a toy company)
- Sakura's biggest supporter and fan
- Second cousin to Sakura (their mothers were cousins)

**Subtext:** Tomoyo has a not-so-subtle romantic love for Sakura, but prioritizes Sakura's happiness above her own feelings. She supports Sakura's relationship with Syaoran without jealousy.

In the original Japanese, her feelings are more explicit than in the edited English dub (Cardcaptors), which downplayed the show's various LGBTQ+ relationships.
