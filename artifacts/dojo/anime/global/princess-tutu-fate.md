## Knowledge

In *Princess Tutu* (2002), Ahiru is literally a **duck** who transforms into a girl and the magical ballerina **Princess Tutu**.

**Her tragic fate:** If Ahiru ever confesses her love to Prince Mytho, she will **turn into a speck of light and vanish forever**. She's doomed to help restore the prince's shattered heart while never being able to express her feelings.

**The metafictional twist:** The characters are trapped in a story being written by Drosselmeyer, a dead author who loves tragedies. He manipulates events from beyond the grave. The series becomes about the characters fighting against their scripted fates and the nature of storytelling itself.

The show deconstructs fairy tales and ballet stories while being genuinely beautiful and heartbreaking. It features classical music throughout (Tchaikovsky, etc.) and actual ballet terminology.
