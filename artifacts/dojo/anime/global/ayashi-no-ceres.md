## Knowledge

In *Ayashi no Ceres* (Ceres, Celestial Legend, 2000), Aya Mikage discovers she's the reincarnation of **Ceres**, a tennyo (celestial maiden) from Japanese folklore.

**The legend:** Ceres descended from heaven and had her hagoromo (feathered robe) stolen by a man who then forced her to become his wife. The Mikage family descends from this union.

**The twin twist:** Aya's twin brother Aki becomes possessed by **the Progenitor** - the ancestor who originally stole Ceres's robe. This puts the siblings on opposite sides, with the family hunting Aya to kill the Ceres within her.

The series (by Yuu Watase, who also created Fushigi Yuugi) is darker than typical shoujo, dealing with:
- Family betrayal
- Sexual assault themes
- Violence and death
