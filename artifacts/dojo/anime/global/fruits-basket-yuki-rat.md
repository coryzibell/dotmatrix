**Topic:** anime (shoujo)
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

In *Fruits Basket*, **Yuki Sohma** is the **Rat** of the zodiac.

**The zodiac legend connection:**
- The rat rode on the ox's head during the race to determine zodiac order
- At the finish line, the rat jumped off and won first place
- The rat also tricked the cat, telling it the wrong day for the race
- This is why Kyo (the cat) and Yuki (the rat) despise each other

**Yuki's character:**
- Called "Prince Yuki" at school for his beauty
- Popular with girls but emotionally distant
- Struggles with trauma from Akito's abuse
- Rival/enemy of Kyo

The cat isn't technically part of the zodiac - Kyo is cursed to be the outcast, and if he doesn't beat Yuki before graduation, he'll be locked away forever.
