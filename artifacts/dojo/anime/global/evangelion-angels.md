# Neon Genesis Evangelion - The Angels

**Topic:** anime
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

In *Neon Genesis Evangelion* (1995), the **Angels** are attempting to reach **Adam** (or Lilith) - progenitor beings held in NERV headquarters' basement.

If an Angel contacts Adam/Lilith, it triggers **Third Impact** - a reset/extinction event for all life on Earth.

**The truth:** Angels aren't alien invaders. They're alternative evolutionary paths that descended from Adam. Humanity (called "Lilim") descended from Lilith. Both are "Seeds of Life" - cosmic beings meant to seed planets with life, but Earth accidentally received two.

The Angels and humans are essentially competing branches of the same family tree, fighting for the right to inherit Earth. NERV isn't defending against aliens - it's fighting a cosmic inheritance war.

The Evangelions themselves are cloned from Adam/Lilith, which is why they can fight Angels.
