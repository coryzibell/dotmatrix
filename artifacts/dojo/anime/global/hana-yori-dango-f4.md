In *Hana Yori Dango* (Boys Over Flowers, 1996 anime), **F4** (Flower Four) are the four ultra-wealthy boys who rule Eitoku Academy:

**The Red Card:** When F4 wants a student expelled, they place a **red card** in their locker. This signals the entire school to bully and torment that student until they quit. Teachers look the other way because F4's families essentially own the school.

One of the most influential shoujo manga ever, adapted in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, China, and Thailand.
