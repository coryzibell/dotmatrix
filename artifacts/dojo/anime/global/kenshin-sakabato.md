**What makes it unique:**
- The sharp edge is on the inside (back) of the curve instead of the outside
- This makes it non-lethal - the blunt edge strikes opponents
- Symbolizes Kenshin's vow to never kill again
- He can still use his deadly Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū techniques without killing

**Kenshin's past:**
- Was the legendary assassin "Hitokiri Battousai" during the Bakumatsu
- Killed many people during the revolution
- After the war, he vowed never to kill again
- Wanders as a rurouni (wanderer) seeking atonement

The sakabato represents his redemption and commitment to protecting life rather than taking it.
