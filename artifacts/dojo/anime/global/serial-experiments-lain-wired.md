## Knowledge

In *Serial Experiments Lain* (1998), **The Wired** is a global communications network - essentially their version of the internet.

As the series progresses, the boundary between The Wired and physical reality **dissolves completely**:
- Lain discovers she exists in both realms simultaneously
- Wired phenomena begin manifesting in the real world
- People's digital and physical identities merge
- Eventually the two become indistinguishable

The show explores identity, consciousness, and the nature of reality in a networked world. Made in 1998 (before social media), it was eerily prescient about:
- Online vs. offline identity
- Digital existence as "real" existence
- The blurring of virtual and physical spaces
- Collective consciousness through networks

Lain herself becomes godlike within The Wired, able to rewrite reality and memories.
