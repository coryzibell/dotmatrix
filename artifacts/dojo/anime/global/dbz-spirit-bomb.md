# Dragon Ball Z - Spirit Bomb

**Topic:** anime
**Scope:** global

## Knowledge

The **Spirit Bomb** (Genki Dama in Japanese) is a technique Goku learns from King Kai on his planet in the afterlife.

The user raises their hands and gathers ki/energy donated from all living things - plants, animals, people, even the planet itself. For massive Spirit Bombs, energy can be drawn from across the universe.

**Limitations:**
- Takes a very long time to charge (villains constantly interrupt it)
- Requires willing energy donation
- Can only be used by someone pure of heart
- Drains the user significantly

Used famously against Vegeta, Frieza, Kid Buu, and others. The one against Kid Buu drew energy from Earth's entire population (after Mr. Satan convinced them to raise their hands).

Not to be confused with the **Kamehameha** - Goku's signature beam attack learned from Master Roshi.
