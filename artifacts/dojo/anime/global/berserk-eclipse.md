## Knowledge

In *Berserk* (manga 1989, anime 1997), **The Eclipse** is the event where Griffith sacrifices the entire Band of the Hawk to become **Femto**, a member of the God Hand (demon gods).

**The setup:** Griffith, leader of the Band of the Hawk, is captured, tortured for a year, and reduced to a mutilated husk. In despair, he activates the Behelit (Crimson Behelit/Egg of the King), summoning the God Hand and offering everyone who followed him as a sacrifice.

**The Brand of Sacrifice:** Survivors (only Guts and Casca) are marked with this brand. It:
- Bleeds when demons/apostles are near
- Draws evil spirits to them constantly
- Marks them as prey - hunted by demons forever
- Cannot be removed

The Eclipse is considered one of the darkest, most traumatic moments in manga/anime history. It transforms the story from dark fantasy into a tale of survival and revenge.
