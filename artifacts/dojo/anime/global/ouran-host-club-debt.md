## Knowledge

In *Ouran High School Host Club* (2006), Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an **¥8 million Renaissance vase** and must pay it off by **working as a host** - entertaining the school's female students.

**The twist:** Haruhi is a girl, but the Host Club initially mistakes her for a boy due to:
- Short, messy hair
- Baggy clothes (scholarship student, can't afford the uniform)
- Indifferent demeanor

When they discover she's female, they keep her secret. She continues working as a "male" host and becomes popular for her natural, down-to-earth charm - a refreshing contrast to the other hosts' theatrical personalities.

The show parodies shoujo tropes and reverse harem conventions while telling a genuine story about found family and class differences.

## Quiz Question

In Ouran High School Host Club, what debt does Haruhi owe and how does she pay it off?

## Answer

She owes ¥8 million for breaking a vase and pays it off by working as a host (while pretending to be male).
