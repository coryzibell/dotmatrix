# Pretear - Snow White Adaptation

**Topic:** anime (shoujo/magical girl)
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

In *Pretear* (2001), Himeno transforms by **"preting" (merging/fusing) with the Leafe Knights** - they literally combine bodies. Each knight grants her different elemental powers:

- Wind, water, fire, ice, sound, light, plants

The transformation is intimate - the knight enters her body and they fight as one.

**The fairy tale:** Pretear is a loose adaptation of **Snow White**:
- Himeno = Snow White figure (moves in with wealthy stepfamily)
- Seven Leafe Knights = Seven Dwarfs
- Initially hostile stepsisters = Evil stepsisters (they warm up over time)
- The Princess of Disaster = Evil Queen figure

The title "Pretear" = "Prêt" (French for "ready") + combining with knights. Full title: "Shin Shirayuki-hime Densetsu Pretear" (New Legend of Snow White Pretear).

Created by Junichi Sato (Sailor Moon director) and Kaori Naruse.
