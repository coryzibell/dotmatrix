## Knowledge

In *Vampire Knight* (2008), Cross Academy has two classes:

- **Day Class** - Regular human students who attend during the day
- **Night Class** - All vampires, attending after dark

**The secret:** Day Class students don't know the Night Class are vampires. They just think they're elite, beautiful students (which causes the girls to swoon over them during class changeover).

**The Guardians:** Yuki Cross and Zero Kiryu serve as "Guardians" or prefects, keeping the classes separate and protecting the vampire secret. The irony: Zero is a vampire hunter who was bitten and is slowly becoming a vampire himself.

**The love triangle:** Yuki is caught between:
- Kaname Kuran (pureblood vampire, Night Class president)
- Zero Kiryu (vampire hunter turned vampire)
