# Trigun - Vash's Bounty

**Topic:** anime
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

**Vash the Stampede's** bounty in *Trigun* (1998) is **$$60 billion double dollars** - the highest bounty on the planet.

The bounty exists because Vash is blamed for the complete destruction of the city of **July** - wiped off the map in an instant.

**The irony:** Vash is a pacifist who refuses to kill anyone, even villains trying to murder him. The destruction of July was caused by his twin brother **Knives** manipulating Vash into unleashing his **Angel Arm** - a devastating weapon built into his body that he can't fully control.

Vash spends the series being chased by bounty hunters while trying to protect people and avoid killing, earning him the contradictory nickname "The Humanoid Typhoon."
