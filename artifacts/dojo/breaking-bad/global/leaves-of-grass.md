**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

The evidence that finally exposes Walter White as Heisenberg to Hank is a copy of **Leaves of Grass** by Walt Whitman.

Found in Walt's bathroom, it was inscribed: "To my other favorite W.W. It's an honour working with you. Fondly, G.B." - from Gale Boetticher, who Walt had killed.

Hank recognized the handwriting and initials from Gale's lab notes. This happens in the season 5 mid-finale "Gliding Over All."

Walt keeping the book was hubris - a trophy from his conquest.
