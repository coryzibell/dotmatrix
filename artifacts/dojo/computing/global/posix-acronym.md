# POSIX Acronym

**Topic:** computing
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

POSIX stands for "Portable Operating System Interface" - the X was added to make it sound like Unix (which it standardizes). It was coined by Richard Stallman in response to an IEEE request for a memorable name.

POSIX defines the API, shell, and utilities that operating systems should implement to be considered Unix-compatible. Linux, macOS, and the BSDs are POSIX-compliant (or mostly so). Windows has partial POSIX support through WSL.

## Why It Matters

- Enables portable software across Unix-like systems
- Defines standard syscalls, file operations, process control
- Key specs: POSIX.1 (core), POSIX.2 (shell/utilities)
- Knowing POSIX helps write portable C and shell scripts
