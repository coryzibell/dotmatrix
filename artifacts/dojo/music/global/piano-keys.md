## Knowledge

A standard full-size piano has 88 keys: 52 white and 36 black. This gives just over 7 octaves of range.

Some extended pianos (like Bösendorfer Imperials) go up to 97 keys, but 88 has been the standard since the late 1800s.

## Why It Matters

- Covers the practical range of orchestral music
- Earlier pianos had fewer keys (Mozart's had 61)
- Digital keyboards often have 61 or 76 keys to save space
