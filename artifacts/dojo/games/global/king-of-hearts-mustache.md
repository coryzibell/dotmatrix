## Knowledge

The **King of Hearts** is the only king in a standard deck of playing cards without a mustache. He's also called the "suicide king" because the sword behind his head makes it look like he's stabbing himself.

## Why It Matters

- Classic bar trivia / poker table knowledge
- The design comes from centuries-old French playing cards
- Each king is said to represent a historical king (Hearts = Charlemagne, though this is disputed)
- The "suicide" appearance is likely a degradation of the original design over centuries of copying
