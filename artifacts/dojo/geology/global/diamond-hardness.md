# Diamond: Hardest Natural Substance

**Topic:** geology
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

**Diamond** is the hardest natural substance, rating 10 on the Mohs hardness scale.

Important distinction: **hardness ≠ toughness**.
- Hardness = resistance to scratching
- Toughness = resistance to fracture/impact

Diamond is hard but brittle - it can shatter along cleavage planes if struck. Jade is softer but tougher (more impact resistant).

## Why It Matters

- Why diamonds are used for cutting/drilling tools
- Explains why a diamond ring can scratch anything but can chip if dropped wrong
- Mohs scale is relative, not linear - diamond is ~4x harder than corundum (9)
- Synthetic materials like aggregated diamond nanorods may be harder
