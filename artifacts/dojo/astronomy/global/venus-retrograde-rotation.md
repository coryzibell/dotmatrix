# Venus Retrograde Rotation

**Topic:** astronomy
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

Venus rotates clockwise (retrograde) when viewed from above its north pole - the only planet to do so. A day on Venus (243 Earth days) is longer than its year (225 Earth days).

Uranus is also unusual - it rotates on its side - but Venus is the true retrograde spinner.

## Why It Matters

- Likely caused by a massive ancient collision or gravitational effects
- The Sun rises in the west on Venus
- Challenges assumptions about solar system formation
