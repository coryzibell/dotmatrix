**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

An adult human has **206 bones**. Babies are born with around 270, but many fuse together during development (skull plates, vertebrae, sacrum, etc.).

Almost half (106 bones) are in the hands and feet:
- Each hand: 27 bones
- Each foot: 26 bones

## Why It Matters

- Classic anatomy trivia
- The fusion process explains why babies are so flexible
- Some people have extra bones (sesamoid bones, cervical ribs) - counts can vary slightly
- The smallest bone is the stapes (stirrup) in the ear, about 3mm
