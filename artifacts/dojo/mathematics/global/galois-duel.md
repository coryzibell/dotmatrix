# Galois: The Mathematician Who Died in a Duel

**Topic:** mathematics
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

Évariste Galois was a French mathematician who died in a duel at age 20 in 1832 (likely over a woman). The night before, knowing he might die, he frantically wrote down his mathematical ideas.

Those hastily scrawled notes founded **Galois theory**, which connects field theory and group theory. It took decades for other mathematicians to fully understand what he'd done. His work is fundamental to modern abstract algebra.

## Why It Matters

- One of mathematics' greatest tragedies - imagine what he could have done with a full life
- Galois theory is essential for proving the impossibility of solving quintic equations by radicals
- His story is often used to illustrate how revolutionary ideas can be ahead of their time
