**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

**2520** is the smallest positive integer divisible by every number from 1 to 10.

It's the least common multiple (LCM). To find it, take the highest power of each prime ≤ 10:
- 2³ = 8 (covers 2, 4, 8)
- 3² = 9 (covers 3, 9)
- 5 (covers 5, 10)
- 7

Multiply: 8 × 9 × 5 × 7 = 2520

## Why It Matters

- Project Euler Problem 5
- LCM calculation is fundamental in number theory
- Useful for finding common denominators, scheduling problems
