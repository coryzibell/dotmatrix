## Knowledge

The knight is the only chess piece that can jump over other pieces. It moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular.

## Why It Matters

- Knights are most powerful in closed positions where other pieces are blocked
- They can attack without being attacked back by queens, rooks, or bishops
- "Knight on the rim is dim" - they're weaker on edges with fewer move options
