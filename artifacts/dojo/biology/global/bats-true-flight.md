## Knowledge

Bats are the only mammals capable of true sustained flight. Flying squirrels, sugar gliders, and colugos all glide - they're falling with style. Bats actually flap and generate lift.

There are over 1,400 bat species - nearly 20% of all mammal species.

## Why It Matters

- Critical pollinators and pest controllers
- Echolocation allows hunting in complete darkness
- Their flight evolved independently from birds and insects
