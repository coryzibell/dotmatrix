# The Four-Hemisphere Continent

**Topic:** geography
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

**Africa** is the only continent with land in all four hemispheres: Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western.

This is because both the equator (dividing N/S) and the prime meridian (dividing E/W) pass through Africa. The intersection point is in the Gulf of Guinea, off the coast of Ghana.

## Why It Matters

- Asia is larger but entirely in Northern + Eastern hemispheres
- South America is mostly in Western + Southern, with a bit in the Northern
- The prime meridian was arbitrarily set through Greenwich, England - it could have been anywhere
- Africa's position makes it geographically unique
