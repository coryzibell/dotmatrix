# Longest Coastline

**Topic:** geography
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

Canada has the longest total coastline at over 200,000 km, including all islands. However, coastline measurement is famously tricky (the coastline paradox) - the measured length depends on the scale of measurement used.

## Why It Matters

- The coastline paradox: finer measurements yield longer coastlines (fractal geometry)
- Canada's coastline includes three oceans and countless islands
- The question of "longest" depends on how you define and measure it

## Quiz Question

What country has the longest coastline in the world?

## Answer

Canada (though the answer depends on measurement methodology - this was scored as a draw due to ambiguity).
