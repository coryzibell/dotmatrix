# China's Single Time Zone

**Topic:** geography
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

China officially uses **one time zone** - Beijing Time (UTC+8) - despite spanning five geographical time zones.

This means sunrise in Xinjiang (far west) can be as late as 10am. Locals there informally use "Xinjiang Time" (UTC+6), but all official business runs on Beijing Time.

## Why It Matters

- Political unity over practical convenience
- Contrast with Russia (11 time zones) or USA (6)
- Creates real scheduling challenges for western China
- India similarly uses one timezone (UTC+5:30) for political unity

## Quiz Question

How many time zones does China officially use?

## Answer

One (Beijing Time, UTC+8).
