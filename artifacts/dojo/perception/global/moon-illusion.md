# The Moon Illusion

**Topic:** perception
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

The **moon illusion** is the optical illusion where the moon appears larger near the horizon than when high in the sky. It's purely perceptual - the moon's angular size (~0.5°) is constant.

The leading explanation is **size-distance scaling**: near the horizon, your brain compares the moon to trees, buildings, and terrain, interpreting it as "far away but huge." High in the empty sky with no reference points, it appears smaller.

## Why It Matters

- Demonstrates how perception is constructed, not just received
- You can "break" the illusion by bending over and looking at the horizon moon upside down
- Has puzzled humans since ancient times - Aristotle wrote about it
- Not caused by atmospheric magnification (that's a common misconception)

## Quiz Question
