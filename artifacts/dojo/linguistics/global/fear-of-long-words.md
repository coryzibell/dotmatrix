## Knowledge

The fear of long words is called **hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia** - a deliberately cruel joke, making the word itself terrifyingly long.

The more clinical (and merciful) term is **sesquipedalophobia** (from Latin *sesquipedalis* meaning "a foot and a half long").

## Why It Matters

- Perfect example of linguistic humor / irony
- Similar jokes: the fear of palindromes is "aibohphobia" (itself a palindrome)
- "Sesquipedalian" is a real word meaning "characterized by long words"
- Demonstrates how phobia names are constructed from Greek/Latin roots
