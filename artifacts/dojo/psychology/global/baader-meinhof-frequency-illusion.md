**Topic:** psychology
**Scope:** global
**Date:** 2025-11-30

## Knowledge

The **Baader-Meinhof phenomenon** (or **frequency illusion**) is when you suddenly start noticing something everywhere after first becoming aware of it. Learn a new word, and suddenly you see it three times that week.

It's caused by two cognitive biases working together:
1. **Selective attention** - your brain now flags this thing as relevant
2. **Confirmation bias** - you remember the hits, forget the misses

The name comes from someone on a Minnesota newspaper forum who noticed the German terrorist group "Baader-Meinhof" mentioned twice in 24 hours after first learning about them.

## Why It Matters

- Explains why new car buyers suddenly see "their" car everywhere
- Related to Jung's concept of **synchronicity** (meaningful coincidences) - same phenomenon, different framing
- Useful for understanding how pattern recognition can mislead us
- The frequency didn't change - your attention did
