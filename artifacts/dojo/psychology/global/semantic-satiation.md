## Knowledge

Semantic satiation is the psychological phenomenon where a word temporarily loses meaning after being repeated many times. Say "bowl" 30 times and it starts sounding like meaningless noise.

First described by Leon Jakobovits James in 1962. It's caused by neural fatigue - the repeated firing of the same semantic pathways causes temporary inhibition.

## Why It Matters

- Demonstrates how meaning is constructed through neural activation patterns
- Related to jamais vu (familiar things feeling unfamiliar)
- Analogous to "context drift" in LLMs - repeated patterns lose coherence over long contexts
