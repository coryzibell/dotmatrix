## Knowledge

The **tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon** (TOT state) is when you can't recall a word but feel certain you know it and it's about to come to you.

Characteristics:
- Can often recall partial info: first letter, syllable count, similar words
- Strong feeling of imminent recall
- It's a retrieval failure, not a storage failure - the word is there

Related: **presque vu** ("almost seen") - the French term for similar near-recall experiences.

## Why It Matters

- Demonstrates how memory retrieval works (or fails)
- Increases with age
- More common for proper nouns than common words
- Shows memory isn't binary - partial access is possible
