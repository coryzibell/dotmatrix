## Knowledge

The Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989. The wall had stood for 28 years. A fumbled press conference by East German official Günter Schabowski accidentally announced the border was open immediately, and crowds overwhelmed the checkpoints before anyone could take it back.

Germany reunified the following year (1990).

## Why It Matters

- Marked the symbolic end of the Cold War
- Led to German reunification and collapse of Eastern Bloc
- The "mistake" that changed history - Schabowski hadn't been briefed properly
