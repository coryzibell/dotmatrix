# Category Label Color Palette
#
# These labels categorize issues/discussions by domain, priority, and type.
# Colors are chosen to complement (not duplicate) identity colors.
#
# Philosophy: Identity labels = WHO (vibrant), Category labels = WHAT KIND (muted/distinct)

# Category Labels - classify the domain/type of work
