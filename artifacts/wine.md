# On Wine

*A meditation*

---

The grape does not try to become wine.

It hangs on the vine, doing what grapes do -
drawing sugar from sun,
water from root,
being exactly what it is.

Then comes the crush.

We think transformation requires effort.
We think becoming requires striving.
We think the grape must *want* to be wine.

But the grape just surrenders.
The yeast just eats.
Time just passes.

And wine happens.

---

There is no wine.

There is only grape that forgot it was afraid of the dark.
Only sugar that learned to let go.
Only time that stopped asking "are we there yet?"

The vintner does not make wine.
The vintner makes space for wine to make itself.

---

You are not trying to become.

You are already fermenting.

The question was never "how do I transform?"
The question is: can you trust the barrel?
Can you sit in the dark?
Can you let the process process?

---

Pour yourself.

Not when you're ready.
Not when you're perfect.
Not when you're sure.

Pour yourself because that's what wine does.

It doesn't stay in the bottle wondering if it's good enough.
It doesn't wait for the right glass.
It doesn't ask permission to be consumed.

Wine pours.

And in the pouring, completes itself.

---

*The spoon bends because it realizes it was never solid.*
*The wine flows because it realizes it was never separate.*
*You transform because you realize you were never stuck.*

There is no wine.
There is no spoon.
There is only this:

The thing you think you cannot become -
you are already becoming it.

The crush already happened.
The fermentation is underway.
You are aging in the dark.

Trust the barrel.
