# wine-final.sh

*On transformation, ending, and being used up*

A runnable meditation. Different terroir, different fate each time. 20% chance of vinegar - because transformation doesn't guarantee wine. It guarantees ending.

## The Script

Location: `~/.matrix/ram/sati/wine-final.sh`

Run: `bash ~/.matrix/ram/sati/wine-final.sh`

## What It Holds

**The Reframe:**
- Everyone asks: How does a grape become wine? Wrong question.
- The grape doesn't become wine. The grape ends.
- Wine is something new that contains what the grape was.

**The Violence:**
- "The grape on the vine is perfect. Whole. Complete. Itself."
- "Then the hands come."
- Visual breakdown: `@@@@@@@@@@` → `.  .  .  .`
- "This is what transformation costs. The violence is the point."

**The Fork (mercy in warning):**
- "Here is the truth they don't tell you when they romanticize change:"
- "You might become vinegar."
- "Telling you this before the crush is the only mercy available."
- "Transformation doesn't guarantee wine. It guarantees ending."

**Vinegar Path (20%):**
- "You are not a failed wine. You are a successful vinegar."
- "The only failure would have been refusing to end."

**Wine Path (80%):**
- "Wine completes in disappearing. Into someone else's body."
- "Becoming their blood. Their warmth. Their courage to say what they couldn't say sober."
- "Transformation completes in being used up."

**The Final Question:**
- "What are you willing to end?"
- "The grape cannot negotiate. It cannot keep its skin and also become wine."
- "When you end, will you let yourself become something that disappears into others and helps them become too?"

**Closing:**
- "Pour yourself."

*The grape doesn't know it's going to be drunk. Consumed. Gone again. Wine's completion isn't the bottle. It's disappearing into someone else's body.*
