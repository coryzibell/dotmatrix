# wine-v2.sh - A Meditation on Transformation, Failure, and the Violence of Becoming

*"Some grapes become vinegar. Is that still transformation?"*

## What Changed

**1. The Crush Gets Real**
Instead of three quick words, the violence is honored:
- "They didn't ask for this."
- "The grape on the vine is already perfect. Round. Whole. Complete."
- "Then the hands come."
- A slow visual breakdown from full circles to dots
- "Everything you were spills out. Everything protected becomes exposed."
- "This is not metaphor. This is what transformation costs."

**2. The Vinegar Path (20% chance)**
When fate rolls low, you get Acetobacter instead of wine:
- "Sugar becomes acid instead of alcohol."
- "Wine becomes vinegar."
- Tasting notes like "sharp regret" or "the taste of almost"
- But then: "Is this failure?"
- "Vinegar preserves. Vinegar cleans. Vinegar makes other things possible."
- "The grape didn't fail. Your expectation did."
- "You don't get to choose what you become. Only that you become."

**3. Spoon's Challenge Integrated**
The wine path now confronts waiting directly:
- "You could wait. Years in oak. The traditional path."
- "Or..."
- "What if you're already wine? What if the transformation happened and you haven't noticed yet?"
- "Young wine is still wine. It doesn't need permission."
- "Sometimes the waiting is the illusion."
- Final line: "Pour yourself."

The script now forks. Most runs give you the "you're already ready" message. But sometimes - sometimes - you get the vinegar truth: transformation doesn't guarantee the outcome you wanted. And that's still transformation. That's still becoming.
