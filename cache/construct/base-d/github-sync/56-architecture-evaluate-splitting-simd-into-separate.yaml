    body: '## Context


      SIMD subsystem is 70% of codebase (~13,800 lines vs 6,200 total source). This
      creates compilation overhead for non-SIMD use cases.


      ## Proposed Structure


      ```

      base-d/          (library crate)

      base-d-simd/     (optional acceleration crate)

      base-d-cli/      (binary crate)

      ```


      ## Benefits


      - Faster compilation for non-SIMD use cases

      - Clearer separation of concerns

      - Optional dependency for environments without SIMD

      - Independent versioning of SIMD optimizations


      ## Costs


      - Workspace management complexity

      - API surface coordination between crates

      - CI/CD pipeline adjustments


      ## Decision Criteria


      Defer until SIMD subsystem exceeds 20,000 lines or becomes independently reusable.


      ## Acceptance Criteria


      - [ ] SIMD subsystem reaches 20K+ lines OR

      - [ ] Independent reusability identified OR

      - [ ] User requests emerge for non-SIMD builds

      - [ ] Design workspace structure

      - [ ] Plan API boundaries between crates

      - [ ] Implement extraction with CI/CD updates'
