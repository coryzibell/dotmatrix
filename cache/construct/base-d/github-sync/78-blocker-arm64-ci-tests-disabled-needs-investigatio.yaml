    title: '[BLOCKER] ARM64 CI tests disabled - needs investigation'
    body: "## Context\n\nFrom Construct review of `base-d` project. Niobe identified\
      \ CI gap.\n\n**Source:** `~/.matrix/cache/construct/base-d/cicd-review.md`\n\
      \n### Problem\n\nARM64 tests are commented out in CI with `# TODO: fix ARM64\
      \ tests`. This means ARM64 SIMD code is shipping without CI verification.\n\n\
      ### Impact\n\n- ARM64 bugs ship undetected\n- Platform parity not verified\n\
      - False confidence in release quality\n\n### Solution\n\n1. Investigate why\
      \ tests were disabled\n2. Fix underlying issue\n3. Re-enable ARM64 CI matrix\n\
      \n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] ARM64 tests passing in CI\n- [ ] CI matrix\
      \ includes both x86_64 and ARM64\n- [ ] SIMD tests run on both platforms\n-\
      \ [ ] No `TODO: fix` comments remain\n\n### Handoff\n\nNiobe investigates \u2192\
      \ Trinity debugs if needed \u2192 Neo merges"
