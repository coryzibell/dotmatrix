  ## Summary

  Fellas identity was consolidated into Smith ("one or many, he scales") but references remain throughout documentation, causing confusion.

  ## Current State

  **Fellas referenced in:**
  - `neo.md` line 9: "The Fellas-first rule lives there"
  - `neo.md` lines 44-57: Entire "Smith vs Fellas" section
  - `orchestration.md`: Fellas-first language
  - `agents/fellas.md`: Legacy file still exists

  **But:**
  - No `identities/fellas.md` (canonical location)
  - CLAUDE.md table updated to show Smith scaling
  - No `ram/fellas/` directory

  ## Decision Needed

  **Option A: Complete the consolidation**
  1. Remove Fellas references from neo.md
  2. Update orchestration.md to remove Fellas-first language
  3. Document Smith's 1:N scaling as canonical parallel approach
  4. Delete `agents/fellas.md`

  **Option B: Restore Fellas**
  1. Create `identities/fellas.md`
  2. Create `ram/fellas/`
  3. Add to CLAUDE.md table
  4. Keep Smith vs Fellas distinction

  ## Recommendation

  Option A - the consolidation already happened in CLAUDE.md. Complete it.
