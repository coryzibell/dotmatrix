title: Document schema design ownership between Architect and Merovingian
type: issue
labels:
- documentation
- architecture
- identity:architect
- identity:merovingian
body: '## Problem


  Database schema design sits ambiguously between two identities:


  - **Architect**: System structure, data model as architecture

  - **Merovingian**: API contracts, schema as contract between app and database


  Currently no explicit documentation on who owns what.


  ## Source


  Identified independently by both Architect and Merovingian during Construct identity
  reviews.


  ## Proposed Resolution


  From Merovingian''s review:


  > - Architect designs *conceptual* data model (entities, relationships, domains)

  > - Merovingian translates to *physical* schema (DDL, constraints, indexes)


  ## Files to Update


  - `~/.claude/identities/architect.md` - clarify conceptual data modeling scope

  - `~/.claude/identities/merovingian.md` - add physical schema design to role

  - `~/.claude/orchestration.md` - document the handoff pattern


  ## Example Scenarios


  | Task | Owner | Reason |

  |------|-------|--------|

  | "What entities do we need for user management?" | Architect | Conceptual modeling
  |

  | "Design the users table DDL with constraints" | Merovingian | Physical schema
  |

  | "How should user-service relate to auth-service data?" | Architect | System integration
  |

  | "Define the foreign key relationships in the schema" | Merovingian | Schema contract
  |
