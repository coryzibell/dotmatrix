title: Fix Keymaker example task in CLAUDE.md
type: issue
labels:
- bug
- documentation
- identity:keymaker
body: '## Problem


  In CLAUDE.md, the Keymaker row in the identity table has an incorrect example task:


  > "Review this auth flow for vulnerabilities"


  This is **Cypher''s job**, not Keymaker''s. Keymaker *builds* auth mechanisms, Cypher
  *audits* them.


  ## Source


  Identified in Keymaker''s identity review during Construct audit.


  ## Fix


  Change the example task to match `orchestration.md`:


  ```

  "Implement JWT token refresh flow"

  ```


  ## Files to Update


  - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - identity table, Keymaker row
