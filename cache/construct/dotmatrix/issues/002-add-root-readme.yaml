body: '## Summary


  No README.md exists at `~/.claude/`. There are 269 markdown files but no entry point
  for newcomers.


  ## The Gap


  Current "start here" candidates:

  - `CLAUDE.md` (user config, auto-loaded by Claude)

  - `orchestration.md` (dispatch rules)

  - `paths.md` (workflows)

  - `PLATFORMS.md` (OS quirks)

  - `identities/_base.md` (protocol)


  Which one is actually first? Unclear.


  ## Proposed README


  ```markdown

  # dotmatrix


  Your `.claude` configuration, supercharged.


  ## Quick Start


  1. Clone this repo to `~/.claude/`

  2. Read `CLAUDE.md` for environment setup

  3. Try `/smith` or `/sati` to invoke an identity

  4. Run `./matrix/garden-paths.sh` to see collaboration patterns


  ## Architecture


  - 27 AI identities, each with specialized expertise

  - 3-tier storage (RAM, Cache, Artifacts)

  - Workflows: Construct (analyze), Broadcast (publish), Prune (clean)


  See `orchestration.md` for dispatch rules.

  ```


  10 lines. Entry point established.
