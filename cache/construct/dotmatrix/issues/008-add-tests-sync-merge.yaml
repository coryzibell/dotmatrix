title: "Add tests for sync_merge.py three-way merge logic"

  ## Summary

  sync_merge.py contains critical three-way merge logic used by all sync operations. Zero test coverage. Wrong merge decisions = data loss.

  ## Risk Assessment

  From Deus analysis:
  - **Risk:** Merge conflicts incorrectly resolved → data loss on GitHub
  - **Impact:** User edits overwritten, local changes lost
  - **Detection:** Silent. User discovers after data already overwritten.

  ## What To Test

  ### Priority 1 (Must Test)
  - `compute_field_changes()` - all change type combinations
  - `merge_labels()` - union/intersection logic, edge cases (empty, all added, all removed)
  - `merge_fields()` - conflict resolution paths

  ### Edge Cases
  - Deeply nested data structures
  - Non-string/list types
  - Empty string vs None normalization

  ## Estimated Effort

  - 300-400 lines of test code
  - 8-12 hours implementation
  - Covers 80% of data loss risk

  ## From Construct

  Identified by: Deus (test analysis)

  > "Single point of failure for all sync operations... prevents cascading data loss across all sync scripts."
