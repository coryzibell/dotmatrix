title: Delete legacy agents/ directory
type: issue

body: '## Summary


  The `agents/` directory is legacy. The `identities/` directory is now the source
  of truth for identity definitions.


  Having both creates confusion for anyone exploring the codebase - three places define
  identities (`agents/`, `identities/`, `commands/`).


  ## Current State


  - `~/.claude/agents/` - 27 files (old format, includes deleted `fellas.md`)

  - `~/.claude/identities/` - 27 files (new format with frontmatter, `_base.md`)

  - `~/.claude/commands/` - 23 files (slash command wrappers)


  ## Action


  Delete the entire `agents/` directory.


  ```bash

  rm -rf ~/.claude/agents/

  ```


  ## Impact


  - Eliminates newcomer confusion

  - Single source of truth for identity definitions

  - No functionality lost (identities/ has all definitions)


  ## From Construct

  which to edit."
