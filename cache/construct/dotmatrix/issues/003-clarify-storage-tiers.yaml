title: Clarify storage tier documentation
type: issue
labels:

- identity:morpheus
body: '## Summary


  Storage tier descriptions vary across files, creating confusion.


  ## Inconsistencies Found


  **CLAUDE.md says:**

  > `~/.claude/ram/` - Identity-specific working directories (temporary, session-based)


  **_base.md says:**

  > This ensures context survives across sessions.


  **Architecture doc says:**

  > Pruned regularly - not long-term storage


  Is RAM cross-session or not? The docs contradict themselves.


  ## Recommendation


  Single source of truth in CLAUDE.md. Other files reference it:


  ```markdown

  ## Storage Tiers


  | Tier | Location | Purpose | Retention |

  |------|----------|---------|-----------|

  | **RAM** | `~/.claude/ram/{identity}/` | Session notes, working memory | Project-based
  (see Prune) |

  | **Cache** | `~/.claude/cache/` | Workflow artifacts, handoffs | Per-workflow |

  | **Artifacts** | `~/.claude/artifacts/` | Permanent tools, templates | Forever
  |


  See `paths.md` for Prune retention policy.

  ```
