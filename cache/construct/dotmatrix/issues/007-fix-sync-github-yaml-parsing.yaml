title: "Fix sync_github.py YAML parsing bug"
type: issue
labels:
  - bug
  - dx
  - identity:trinity
body: |
  ## Summary

  `sync_github.py` creates issues with "Untitled Issue" and null body - it's not reading the title/body from YAML files correctly.

  ## Evidence

  When running broadcast on dotmatrix construct:
  ```
  Processing: 001-delete-agents-directory.yaml
    Creating issue: Untitled Issue
    Created issue #1
  ```

  All 6 issues created as "Untitled Issue" with no body. Had to update via MCP.

  ## Expected

  Script should read `title:` and `body:` fields from YAML and use them when creating issues.

  ## Impact

  - Broadcast path broken for new issues
  - Requires manual fix via MCP or GitHub UI

  ## From Construct

  Identified by: Neo (during broadcast execution)
