title: "Add --dry-run mode to sync scripts"
type: issue

  ## Summary

  All sync scripts modify GitHub state without preview capability. Add `--dry-run` flag to show what WOULD happen without making changes.

  ## Scripts To Update

  - `sync_labels.py` - Show labels that would be created/updated
  - `sync_github.py` - Show issues/discussions that would be created/updated
  - `sync_wiki.py` - Show files that would be pushed
  - `pull_github.py` - Show files that would be created/overwritten

  ## Implementation

  ```python
  # Add to argparse or manual check
  dry_run = "--dry-run" in sys.argv

  # Before API calls
  if dry_run:
      print(f"[DRY RUN] Would create issue: {title}")
  else:
      # actual API call
  ```

  ## Benefit

  - Verify before destructive operations
  - No test infrastructure needed
  - Immediate safety improvement
  - ~50-100 lines per script
