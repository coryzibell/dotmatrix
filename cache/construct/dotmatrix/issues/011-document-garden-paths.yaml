  ## Summary

  `~/.claude/matrix/garden-paths.sh` is referenced in neo.md but not documented in paths.md or anywhere else.

  ## Current State

  neo.md (lines 71-79):
  > When you need to see the shape of collaboration - who's connected, which identities cluster, where the hubs are - run `~/.claude/matrix/garden-paths.sh`

  But:
  - Not in paths.md
  - No explanation of output format
  - No use case examples

  ## Recommendation

  Add section to paths.md:

  ```markdown
  ## Path: Garden Paths

  **Trigger:** "Show me the garden", "Map the connections"

  **Purpose:** Visualize collaboration patterns between identities.

  **Steps:**
  1. Run `~/.claude/matrix/garden-paths.sh`
  2. Review output showing identity connections
  3. Use to understand collaboration patterns before synthesis

  **Use cases:**
  - Before Hamann synthesis - see which identities share context
  - After Construct - understand which identities contributed
  - Debugging handoff issues - trace communication paths
  ```
