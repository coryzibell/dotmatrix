  \nAnd then what? Smith gets a task: \"Implement these 47 recommendations\"?\n\n\
  ## The Missing Bridge\n\nWhat's latent but unexplored:\n- **Construct \u2192 Remediate\
  \ path**: Workflow that takes Construct outputs and generates prioritized, scoped\
  \ tasks\n- **Issue generation from findings**: Construct writes YAML issues automatically\
  \ for Broadcast\n- **Acceptance criteria synthesis**: Each recommendation becomes\
  \ a testable requirement\n\n## Proposed Extension\n\nAdd Phase 9: **Remediation\
  \ Planning**\n\n```\nAfter synthesis, optionally:\n1. Smith reviews findings, estimates\
  \ effort\n2. Hamann prioritizes (blockers \u2192 improvements \u2192 ideas)\n3.\

  \ docs \u2192 PR\n\nIf fix is ambiguous:\n- Refactor this module \u2192 Issue\n\
  - Improve this UX \u2192 Discussion\n\n## Discussion\n\n- Should Construct auto-generate\
  \ issues, or is manual curation valuable?\n- Where's the line between \"obvious\
