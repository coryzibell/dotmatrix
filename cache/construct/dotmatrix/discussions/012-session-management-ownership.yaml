  > "Session management - Stateful sessions, cookie handling, session stores. Currently
  unclear if this is Keymaker or Merovingian (data flow)."


  ## The Ambiguity


  Session management touches both domains:


  **Keymaker''s claim:**

  - Sessions are access control mechanisms

  - Cookie auth is authentication

  - Session tokens are... tokens


  **Merovingian''s claim:**

  - Session stores are data flows

  - Session state is a contract between client and server

  - Cookie handling is part of the HTTP contract


  ## Keymaker''s Recommendation


  > "Suggestion: Keymaker - it''s an access control mechanism"


  Sessions determine *who can access what*. That''s authentication/authorization,
  not data flow design.


  ## Proposed Resolution


  | Aspect | Owner | Reason |

  |--------|-------|--------|

  | Session token format | Keymaker | Token design |

  | Session storage strategy | Merovingian | Data persistence contract |

  | Session validation logic | Keymaker | Access control |

  | Session cookie attributes | Keymaker | Security settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
  |


  ## Discussion


  - Is this split too granular?

  - Should one identity own it entirely?

  - Does this even come up often enough to matter?
