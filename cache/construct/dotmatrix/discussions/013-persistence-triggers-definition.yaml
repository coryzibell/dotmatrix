  > "`_base.md` says persist ''when completing significant work.'' **Too vague.**
  What''s significant?"


  ## Current Guidance


  From `_base.md`:

  > "When completing significant work, write a summary to your RAM directory"


  This is subjective. Different identities interpret "significant" differently.


  ## Smith''s Proposed Triggers


  Persist when:

  - Implementation spans multiple files

  - Design decisions were made

  - Future work needs context

  - Session might end before completion


  ## Additional Considerations


  - **Research findings** (Tank) - always persist?

  - **Architectural decisions** (Architect) - always ADR?

  - **Security findings** (Cypher) - always document?

  - **Quick fixes** (Kid) - never persist?


  ## Proposed Framework


  | Trigger | Persist? | Reason |

  |---------|----------|--------|

  | Multi-file change | Yes | Context needed for review/continuation |

  | Design decision made | Yes | Decision rationale is valuable |

  | Research completed | Yes | Findings should be reusable |

  | Bug found and fixed | Maybe | Only if root cause analysis is valuable |

  | Simple command executed | No | No lasting context |

  | Session ending mid-task | Yes | Continuation requires context |


  ## Discussion


  - Should persistence be identity-specific or universal?

  - Is "session might end" a valid trigger (how would identity know)?

  - Should there be a "persist threshold" based on token count or time spent?
