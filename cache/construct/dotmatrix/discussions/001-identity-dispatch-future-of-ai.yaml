  > "Right now, we think of AI as ''a chatbot that codes.'' dotmatrix reveals a different
  model: **AI as a team of specialists**."


  ## The Insight


  You don''t ask "the AI" to build your app. You ask:

  - **Architect** to design it

  - **Smith** to implement it

  - **Deus** to test it

  - **Cypher** to break it

  - **Morpheus** to document it


  Each identity has **constrained scope**. That constraint reduces hallucination and
  increases quality.


  ## Why This Matters


  Single-threaded mega-prompts lead to:

  - Context drift over long sessions

  - Hallucination from mixed concerns

  - No specialization


  dotmatrix solves this by:

  - Breaking work into focused identities (single responsibility)

  - Explicit handoffs (no silent context leakage)

  - Model stratification (Opus orchestrates, Sonnet executes)


  ## The Matrix Theme Isn''t Decoration


  It''s a **shared mental model** that maps roles to archetypes everyone already knows.


  When you read an identity''s output, you can *hear* them. That''s storytelling as
  API design.


  ## Discussion


  - Is this the future of AI-assisted development?

  - What would it take for this pattern to go mainstream?

  - Are there domains where single-threaded AI is actually better?
