  I look at code and find holes. But **threat modeling** is proactive."


  ## Current State


  Cypher''s role is reactive:

  - Security audits (review existing code)

  - Red teaming (break existing systems)

  - Vulnerability discovery (find holes in implementation)


  ## Proposed Addition


  Add **threat modeling** as a proactive capability:


  Before code is written, ask:

  - What are we trying to protect?

  - Who are the adversaries?

  - What are their capabilities?

  - What are the attack surfaces?


  ## The Gap


  > "Architect designs systems, but they don''t design *threat models*. I should."


  Currently no identity owns proactive security design. Architect handles system structure,
  but not adversarial thinking about that structure.


  ## Discussion


  - Should threat modeling be Cypher''s domain?

  - Or should it be a collaboration between Architect (structure) and Cypher (threats)?

  - Is this scope creep, or a natural extension?


  ## Proposed Workflow


  1. Architect designs system structure

  2. Cypher builds threat model for that structure

  3. Keymaker implements auth based on threat model

  4. Smith implements features

  5. Cypher audits implementation against threat model
