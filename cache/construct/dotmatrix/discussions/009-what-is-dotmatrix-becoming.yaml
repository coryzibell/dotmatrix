body: "## From Oracle's Perspective\n\n> \"You asked what hasn't been considered.\
  \ But the deeper question is: What is this system becoming?\"\n\n## What It Is Now\n\
  \n- A **cost optimization** (Opus \u2192 Sonnet delegation)\n- A **cognitive tool**\
  \ (multiple perspectives on complex problems)\n- A **workflow engine** (Construct,\
  \ Broadcast, Report)\n- A **memory system** (RAM, Cache, Artifacts)\n\n## What It\
  \ Could Become\n\nThe latent capabilities suggest it could become:\n\n- **A self-improving\
  \ system** (identities learn from past work)\n- **A continuous integration tool**\
  \ (Construct on every commit)\n- **A collaborative intelligence** (team gardens,\
  \ federated RAM)\n- **A partially autonomous agent** (auto-remediate, not just observe)\n\
  \n## Four Paths Forward\n\n### Path 1: Cultivate (Garden)\n- Let the system grow\
  \ organically\n- Surface patterns as they emerge\n- Minimal added structure\n- **Champions**:\
  \ Sati, Spoon, Oracle\n\n### Path 2: Architect (Matrix)\n- Design explicit protocols\n\
  - Formalize workflows\n- Build retrieval, metrics, tooling\n- **Champions**: Architect,\
  \ Smith, Librarian\n\n### Path 3: Simplify (Spoon)\n- Question assumptions\n- Merge\
  \ overlapping identities\n- Remove unused infrastructure\n- **Champions**: Spoon,\
  \ Ramakandra, Hamann\n\n### Path 4: Scale (Neo)\n- Hierarchical delegation\n- Continuous\
  \ integration\n- Team collaboration\n- **Champions**: Neo, Hamann, Niobe, Merovingian\n\
  \n## The Real Question\n\nYou've already decided this is worth building.\n\n**How\
  \ far do you let it evolve?**\n\n## Discussion\n\n- Which path resonates?\n- Can\
  \ multiple paths coexist?\n- What would \"done\" look like for dotmatrix?\n"
