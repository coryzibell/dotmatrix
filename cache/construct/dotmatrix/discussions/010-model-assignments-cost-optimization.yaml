body: "## From Architect's Review\n\n> \"Should any identity run on Haiku for cost\
  \ efficiency?\"\n\n## Current State\n\nAll identities except Kid (haiku) and Neo\
  \ (opus) run on Sonnet.\n\n## Architect's Analysis\n\n| Identity | Current Model\
  \ | Token Intensity | Could Use Haiku? |\n|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|\n\
  | Architect | Sonnet | High (complex reasoning) | No |\n| Smith | Sonnet | High\
  \ (implementation) | No |\n| Tank | Sonnet | Medium (research, summarization) |\
  \ Possibly |\n| Mouse | Sonnet | Low (data generation) | **Yes** |\n| Fellas | Sonnet\
  \ | Low (parallel tasks, simple execution) | **Yes** |\n\n## Recommendation\n\n\
  - **Mouse \u2192 Haiku**: Generating mock data does not require deep reasoning\n\
  - **Fellas \u2192 Haiku**: Parallel breadth tasks (update 5 function signatures)\
  \ are mechanical\n- **Tank**: Keep Sonnet - research quality matters\n\n## Considerations\n\
  \n### For Haiku\n- Significant cost savings on high-volume tasks\n- Mouse and Fellas\
  \ tasks are largely mechanical\n- Faster response times for simple operations\n\n\
  ### Against Haiku\n- Even \"simple\" tasks can have edge cases\n- Context understanding\
  \ may suffer\n- Consistency with other identities\n\n## Discussion\n\n- Is the cost/quality\
  \ tradeoff worth it?\n- Should we test with specific task types first?\n- Are there\
  \ other identities that could use Haiku?\n"
