  > "Right now Construct is manual. Latent capability: Run Construct on every commit."


  ## The Vision


  Imagine:

  - Push to `main`

  - GitHub Action triggers Construct

  - 22 identities audit the change

  - Findings auto-generate issues/PRs

  - You get a "health score" per commit


  ## What This Would Enable


  - **Continuous audit**: Every change reviewed by specialized perspectives

  - **Trend tracking**: "Security score improved 15% this quarter"

  - **Early warning**: Cypher catches vulnerability before it reaches production

  - **Documentation drift**: Morpheus notices when code changes but docs don''t


  ## Technical Challenges


  - **Cost**: 22 identity dispatches per commit = expensive

  - **Time**: Full Construct takes ~30 minutes

  - **Noise**: Most commits don''t need full audit


  ## Possible Solutions


  - **Construct Lite**: Cypher + Deus only (security + tests) for regular commits

  - **Construct Full**: All 22 for PRs to main

  - **Smart triggers**: Only audit changed files/modules

  - **Cached context**: Reuse architecture analysis across commits


  ## Implementation Path


  1. Create `construct-lite.yaml` GitHub Action

  2. Dispatch subset of identities (Cypher, Deus, Morpheus)

  3. Post summary as PR comment

  4. Full Construct remains manual for deep analysis


  ## Discussion


  - Is the cost/benefit worth it?

  - Which identities matter most for CI?

  - How do you prevent audit fatigue?
