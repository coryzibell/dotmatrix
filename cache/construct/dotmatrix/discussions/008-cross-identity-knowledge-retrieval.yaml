  > "You''ve built context persistence, not context retrieval."


  ## The Problem


  Each identity has RAM. Files accumulate. 130 markdown files. 27,193 lines.


  But how do identities **access** that context?


  Right now:

  - Each identity reads their own RAM at session start

  - Identities don''t read other identities'' RAM

  - Neo can point to specific files manually


  ## The Scenario


  What if:

  - Tank researched SIMD patterns 3 months ago

  - Smith is implementing SIMD today

  - Smith has no way to know Tank''s research exists


  The knowledge is **there** but not **discoverable**.


  ## What''s Missing


  - **Cross-identity search**: "Find all files mentioning ''authentication'' across
  all RAM directories"

  - **Temporal search**: "What did we learn about testing 2 weeks ago?"

  - **Semantic links**: When Smith writes about auth, does the system suggest Tank''s
  auth research?


  ## Proposed Solutions


  **Simple (bash):**

  ```bash

  # Search all RAM

  grep -r "authentication" ~/.claude/ram/

  ```


  **Medium (tags):**

  - Identities add `#tags` to files

  - Search by tag: `find-by-tag.sh authentication`


  **Advanced (suggested context):**

  - When Neo dispatches Smith on a task

  - Automatically search RAM for related past work

  - Include relevant files in context


  ## Implementation Ideas


  1. `search-ram.sh` - grep wrapper for cross-identity search

  2. Tag convention: `<!-- tags: auth, security, jwt -->` in markdown

  3. Neo prompt: "Before dispatching, check if any identity has researched this topic"


  ## Discussion


  - How important is cross-identity knowledge sharing?

  - Is simple grep enough, or do we need structured retrieval?

  - Should identities be able to read each other''s RAM directly?
