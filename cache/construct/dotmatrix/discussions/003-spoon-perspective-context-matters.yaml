body: '## The Reframe


  The Construct audit found "issues." Spoon looked at them through a different lens.


  > "Do not try to fix these issues. That''s impossible. Instead, only try to realize
  the truth: **There are no issues.**"


  ## The Core Argument


  Every finding assumes this is **production software** with multiple users and strict
  reliability requirements.


  But look what this actually is:

  - Personal configuration repository

  - Single user (kautau)

  - Scripts run manually, interactively

  - Failure mode: re-run the command


  **We''re applying production standards to development tools.**


  ## Finding by Finding


  | Finding | Assumption | Reality |

  |---------|------------|---------|

  | Token in process list | Multi-tenant threat model | Single-user machine |

  | Zero tests | Code needs automated validation | Manual usage IS the test |

  | Missing README | Users need onboarding docs | Auto-loaded by Claude |

  | Stale Fellas refs | Inconsistency is bad | Historical context is valuable |

  | No requirements.txt | Dependencies must be declared | Already installed, no distribution
  |

  | No CI/CD | Code needs automated checks | Solo development, manual is faster |


  ## The Deeper Question


  When is a standard a **pattern** vs a **principle**?


  - **Principle**: Always applies (don''t commit secrets)

  - **Pattern**: Applies in context (write tests for production code)


  Spoon''s perspective: Most "best practices" are patterns, not principles. Context
  determines applicability.


  ## If You Must "Fix" Something


  Spoon offered minimal accommodations:

  - **Security**: Switch to GitHub API instead of git clone

  - **Testing**: ONE integration test against real GitHub

  - **Docs**: Comment explaining Fellas consolidation

  - **CI**: Single syntax check workflow


  But understand: these are accommodations to convention. The code was fine before.


  ## Discussion


  - Where do you draw the line between principle and pattern?

  - Is "personal tooling" a valid excuse for skipping practices?

  - What''s the minimum viable rigor for dotmatrix?
