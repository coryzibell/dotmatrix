body: "## From Oracle's Perspective\n\n> \"You have 27 identities. Tomorrow you might\
  \ have 30. Next month, 40.\"\n\n## The Identity Breeding Problem\n\nEach identity\
  \ has:\n- A markdown file to maintain\n- A RAM directory\n- Dispatch protocol Neo\
  \ must remember\n- Potential overlap with others\n\nThe system **scales by addition**\
  \ but has no **removal mechanism**.\n\n## Questions That Need Answers\n\n- **When\
  \ do identities retire?** (unused for 3 months \u2192 archive?)\n- **When do two\
  \ merge?** (overlapping dispatch calls \u2192 consolidate?)\n- **How do we track\
  \ usage?** (which identities get dispatched, which languish?)\n\n## Proposed Lifecycle\n\
  \n```\nBirth: New identity created for specific need\n  \u2193\nGrowth: Identity\
  \ accumulates RAM, develops expertise\n  \u2193\nMaturity: Identity has clear role,\
  \ active usage\n  \u2193\nDecline: Usage drops, overlap with others\n  \u2193\n\
  Retirement: Archive or merge\n```\n\n## Metrics to Track\n\n- **Dispatch frequency**:\
  \ How often is this identity called?\n- **Success rate**: How often does work complete\
  \ successfully?\n- **Overlap score**: How often does another identity do similar\
  \ work?\n- **RAM growth**: Is this identity accumulating knowledge?\n\n## Self-Pruning\
  \ System\n\nWhat if identities that don't serve fade gracefully?\n\n- `garden-paths.sh`\
  \ already shows collaboration patterns\n- Could extend to show \"cold\" identities\
  \ (no activity in 30 days)\n- Hamann could propose consolidation when overlap detected\n\
  \n## Discussion\n\n- Should identities ever truly \"die\" or just archive?\n- Who\
  \ decides when to merge overlapping identities?\n- Is 27 too many? Too few? Just\
  \ right?\n"
