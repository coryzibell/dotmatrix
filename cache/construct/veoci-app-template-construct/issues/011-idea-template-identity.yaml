    title: 'Clarify template identity: minimal vs comprehensive'
    body: "# Clarify template identity: minimal vs comprehensive\n\n\n\n**Category:**\
      \ Ideas\n\n\n\nFrom Construct review of `veoci-app-template-construct`. Oracle\
      \ and Spoon raised fundamental questions about template purpose.\n\n**Sources:**\n\
      - `~/.claude/cache/construct/veoci-app-template-construct/perspective-oracle.md`\n\
      - `~/.claude/cache/construct/veoci-app-template-construct/perspective-spoon.md`\n\
      \n## Current State\n\nThe template is caught between two identities:\n\n**Minimal\
      \ Template:**\n- Just enough to start\n- Expects you to add tests, CI/CD, security\
      \ hardening\n- Prioritizes clarity over completeness\n\n**Comprehensive Boilerplate:**\n\
      - Production-ready foundation\n- 300-line auth store with MFA flows\n- Complex\
      \ proxy configuration\n- Anticipates enterprise needs\n\nNeither is wrong, but\
      \ trying to be both creates confusion. The audit applied application standards\
      \ to a template, finding \"issues\" that may be intentional minimalism.\n\n\
      ## The Decision\n\nShould this template be explicitly positioned as:\n\n###\
      \ Option A: Minimal Starter\n*\"Clone, understand in 15 minutes, customize everything\"\
      *\n\n- Remove complex MFA flows (mark as TODO or separate plugin)\n- Simplify\
      \ auth store to essential login/logout/refresh\n- No tests (you'll write tests\
      \ for YOUR code)\n- No CI/CD (you'll set up YOUR deployment)\n- Document the\
      \ intentional gaps\n\n### Option B: Complete Foundation\n*\"Production-ready,\
      \ add your features on top\"*\n\n- Add comprehensive tests\n- Add CI/CD workflows\n\
      - Add security hardening (httpOnly cookies)\n- Add accessibility patterns\n\
      - Add error boundaries\n\n### Option C: Multi-Tier Templates\n*\"Choose your\
      \ complexity budget\"*\n\n```\nveoci-app-minimal    # Routing + API client only\n\
      veoci-app-standard   # Current implementation\nveoci-app-enterprise # Adds tests,\
      \ Storybook, a11y\n```\n\n## Questions to Discuss\n\n1. **Who is the primary\
      \ user?**\n   - Internal Greywall developers (know the stack)\n   - External\
      \ developers (need more guidance)\n   - Both (different templates?)\n\n2. **What's\
      \ the maintenance commitment?**\n   - Actively maintained with versions and\
      \ upgrades\n   - One-time starting point, then projects diverge\n\n3. **What's\
      \ \"in scope\" for a template?**\n   - Auth? (yes)\n   - Testing? (maybe)\n\
      \   - CI/CD? (debatable)\n   - Security hardening? (debatable)\n\n4. **How do\
      \ we communicate this?**\n   - README clearly states scope\n   - \"This template\
      \ is for X, not for Y\"\n\n## Proposed README Addition\n\nWhatever the decision,\
      \ make it explicit:\n\n```markdown\n## What This Template Is\n\nThis is a [minimal/comprehensive]\
      \ starting point for Veoci applications.\n\n**Included:**\n- Vue 3 + TypeScript\
      \ + Vuetify 3 setup\n- Authentication flow (login, logout, token refresh)\n\
      - Routing with auth guards\n- Dev proxy configuration\n\n**Not Included (You\
      \ Add):**\n- Tests (we recommend Vitest)\n- CI/CD (project-specific)\n- Production\
      \ security hardening\n- [Other items...]\n\n**This Template Is For:**\n- Teams\
      \ building Veoci integrations\n- Developers comfortable with Vue 3 Composition\
      \ API\n- Projects that need [X]\n\n**This Template Is NOT For:**\n- Beginners\
