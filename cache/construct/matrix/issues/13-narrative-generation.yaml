    title: Add narrative generation for briefings
    body: '# Add narrative generation for briefings







      From Construct review of `matrix` project. Oracle identified unseen paths during
      perspectives phase.


      **Source:** Oracle''s unseen doors review


      ## Idea


      Generate narrative briefings instead of raw data:


      ```bash

      matrix brief --period=week

      matrix brief --period=today

      matrix brief --identity=smith

      ```


      Output:

      ```

      This week in the Matrix:


      Smith completed 3 blockers and started work on the auth system.

      Trinity traced a nasty race condition in the queue handler.

      Cypher flagged 2 security issues, both now resolved.


      Emerging patterns:

      - Security work is trending up (3 issues this week vs 1 last week)

      - Test coverage improved from 3% to 47%


      Coming up:

      - 2 blockers remain before ship

      - Oracle suggests exploring the caching approach

      ```


      ## Benefits


      - Human-readable summaries

      - Context for stakeholders

      - Spot patterns across time

      - Onboarding new team members


      ## Questions to Consider


      - How much narrative vs. data?

      - Templates or generative?

      - Period options (day, week, sprint, month)?


      ## Implementation Steps


      1. Define briefing template structure

      2. Aggregate data across time periods

      3. Identify notable events and patterns

      4. Generate narrative from template

      5. Add `matrix brief` command


      ## Acceptance Criteria


      - [ ] Daily/weekly/custom period briefings

      - [ ] Per-identity briefings

      - [ ] Pattern detection across time

      - [ ] Human-readable narrative output

      - [ ] Configurable verbosity


      ## Handoff


      1. Oracle defines what makes a good briefing

      2. Morpheus helps with narrative tone

      3. Smith implements generation'
