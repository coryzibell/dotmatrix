    title: Add tests for internal/identity package
    body: '# Add tests for internal/identity package







      From Construct review of `matrix` project. Deus identified critical test coverage
      gap during testing review.


      **Source:** Deus''s test coverage analysis


      ## Problem


      Test coverage is at 3%. Only `internal/ram` has tests. The `internal/identity`
      package has zero test coverage.


      This package handles:

      - Identity validation (`IsValid`)

      - RAM path resolution (`RAMPath`)

      - Identity listing


      These are core functions that other commands depend on.


      ## Solution


      Write comprehensive tests for `internal/identity` package covering:

      - All 27 valid identities recognized

      - Invalid identity names rejected

      - RAM paths resolve correctly

      - Edge cases (empty string, special characters, case sensitivity)


      ## Implementation Steps


      1. Create `internal/identity/identity_test.go`

      2. Write table-driven tests for `IsValid()`

      3. Write tests for `RAMPath()`

      4. Write tests for identity listing functions

      5. Verify edge cases and error conditions

      6. Run coverage report to confirm improvement


      ## Acceptance Criteria


      - [ ] `internal/identity` has >80% test coverage

      - [ ] All 27 identities validated in tests

      - [ ] Invalid inputs properly rejected

      - [ ] Tests pass on all platforms (linux, darwin, windows)

      - [ ] `go test ./...` passes


      ## Handoff


      1. Deus writes the tests

      2. Kid runs `go test ./...` to verify

      3. Neo reviews and merges'
