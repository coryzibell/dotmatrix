    title: Add query language for RAM exploration
    body: '# Add query language for RAM exploration







      From Construct review of `matrix` project. Oracle identified unseen paths during
      perspectives phase.


      **Source:** Oracle''s unseen doors review


      ## Idea


      SQL-like queries instead of hardcoded commands:


      ```bash

      matrix query "SELECT identity, status FROM ram WHERE tags CONTAINS ''blocker''"

      matrix query "COUNT(*) FROM ram GROUP BY identity"

      matrix query "SELECT * FROM ram WHERE modified > ''2025-11-25''"

      ```


      ## Benefits


      - Flexible exploration without new commands

      - Users ask questions matrix designers didn''t anticipate

      - Complements structured frontmatter (issue #07)

      - Power users get power tools


      ## Questions to Consider


      - Learning curve vs. simple commands?

      - How complex should the query language be?

      - Should this replace commands or supplement them?


      ## Implementation Steps


      1. Define query grammar (subset of SQL or custom DSL)

      2. Build query parser

      3. Implement query executor against RAM files

      4. Add `matrix query` command

      5. Document query syntax


      ## Acceptance Criteria


      - [ ] Basic SELECT/WHERE/GROUP BY works

      - [ ] Queries against RAM file metadata

      - [ ] Queries against file content

      - [ ] Helpful error messages for invalid queries

      - [ ] Query syntax documented


      ## Handoff


      1. Oracle defines what queries would be most valuable

      2. Architect designs the query grammar

      3. Smith implements the query engine'
