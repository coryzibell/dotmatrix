    title: Add negative space detection (Test)
    body: '# Add negative space detection







      From Construct review of `matrix` project. Oracle identified unseen paths during
      perspectives phase.


      **Source:** Oracle''s unseen doors review


      ## Idea


      Detect what ISN''T happening:


      ```bash

      matrix silence           # which identities haven''t logged anything recently?

      matrix gaps              # what areas have no coverage?

      matrix forgotten         # stale tasks, abandoned threads

      ```


      ## Benefits


      - Surface blind spots

      - Find dropped balls before they matter

      - Identify underutilized identities

      - Prevent things from falling through cracks


      ## Questions to Consider


      - How to define "should be happening"?

      - False positives (silence might be intentional)?

      - How far back to look?


      ## Implementation Steps


      1. Define "expected activity" baselines

      2. Track last-activity timestamps per identity

      3. Identify gaps in coverage areas

      4. Surface stale/abandoned items

      5. Add silence/gaps/forgotten commands


      ## Acceptance Criteria


      - [ ] Detect identities with no recent activity

      - [ ] Surface stale tasks (configurable threshold)

      - [ ] Identify coverage gaps

      - [ ] Distinguish intentional silence from neglect

      - [ ] Actionable output (not just lists)


      ## Handoff


      1. Oracle defines what "negative space" means practically

      2. Smith implements detection logic

      3. Persephone ensures output is actionable, not anxiety-inducing'
