    title: Add consistent JSON output across all commands
    body: '# Add consistent JSON output across all commands







      From Construct review of `matrix` project. Persephone identified inconsistency
      during user experience review.


      **Source:** Persephone''s UX review


      ## Problem


      JSON support is inconsistent across commands. Some commands support `--json`,
      others don''t. This makes it hard to script with matrix or pipe output to other
      tools.


      ## Solution


      Add `--json` flag to all commands that output data. JSON output should:

      - Be valid JSON (parseable by `jq`)

      - Include consistent structure across commands

      - Suppress decorative output (colors, headers) when in JSON mode


      ## Implementation Steps


      1. Audit all commands for current JSON support

      2. Define consistent JSON envelope structure

      3. Add `--json` flag to commands missing it

      4. Ensure all commands respect the flag

      5. Add tests for JSON output validity


      ## Acceptance Criteria


      - [ ] All data-outputting commands support `--json`

      - [ ] JSON output is valid and parseable by `jq`

      - [ ] Consistent structure across commands

      - [ ] No ANSI colors or decorative text in JSON mode

      - [ ] Documentation lists JSON-capable commands


      ## Handoff


      1. Smith implements JSON support across commands

      2. Deus tests JSON output validity

      3. Morpheus updates documentation'
