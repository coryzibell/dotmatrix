    title: Reorganize commands to reduce overwhelm
    body: '# Reorganize commands to reduce overwhelm







      From Construct review of `matrix` project. Persephone identified UX friction
      during user experience review.


      **Source:** Persephone''s UX review


      ## Problem


      24 commands in a flat list overwhelms users. Running `matrix` or `matrix help`
      shows a wall of text. Users can''t quickly find what they need.


      Additionally:

      - Some commands use subcommands, others don''t (inconsistency)

      - No `matrix help <command>` for detailed help on specific commands


      ## Solution


      Group commands into logical categories:


      ```

      matrix garden     # garden-paths, garden-seeds, tension-map

      matrix security   # breach-points, vault-keys

      matrix quality    # verdict, spec-verify, debt-ledger

      matrix intel      # recon, crossroads, knowledge-gaps

      matrix ops        # flight-check, dependency-map, platform-map

      ```


      Or use a tiered help system:

      - `matrix` - shows categories only

      - `matrix <category>` - shows commands in category

      - `matrix help <command>` - shows detailed help


      ## Implementation Steps


      1. Persephone designs the command groupings and help hierarchy

      2. Smith implements the command router with categories

      3. Update help text to show categories first

      4. Add `matrix help <command>` support

      5. Update README to reflect new structure


      ## Acceptance Criteria


      - [ ] Commands organized into logical categories

      - [ ] `matrix` shows manageable overview (not 24 lines)

      - [ ] `matrix help <command>` works for all commands

      - [ ] Existing command names still work (backwards compatible)

      - [ ] README updated with new structure


      ## Handoff


      1. Persephone designs the groupings

      2. Smith implements the changes

      3. Morpheus updates documentation

      4. Persephone gives final UX approval'
