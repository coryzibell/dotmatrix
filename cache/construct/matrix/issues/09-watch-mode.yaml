    title: Add watch mode for real-time updates
    body: '# Add watch mode for real-time updates







      From Construct review of `matrix` project. Sati proposed during greenfield thinking
      phase.


      **Source:** Sati''s first-look review


      ## Idea


      Add `--watch` flag to commands for real-time garden viewing:


      ```bash

      matrix garden-paths --watch

      matrix tension-map --watch

      ```


      The display updates as RAM files change, like a live dashboard.


      ## Benefits


      - See the garden grow in real-time during work sessions

      - Spot emerging patterns immediately

      - Better visibility into multi-agent workflows


      ## Questions to Consider


      - Which commands benefit from watch mode?

      - Performance impact of file watching?

      - Terminal UI considerations (clearing, redrawing)


      ## Implementation Steps


      1. Add file watcher using fsnotify or polling

      2. Implement terminal clearing/redrawing

      3. Add `--watch` flag to relevant commands

      4. Handle graceful exit (Ctrl+C)

      5. Consider refresh interval configuration


      ## Acceptance Criteria


      - [ ] `--watch` flag works on key commands

      - [ ] Display updates when files change

      - [ ] Clean exit on Ctrl+C

      - [ ] Reasonable CPU usage while watching

      - [ ] Works across platforms


      ## Handoff


      1. Sati prototypes the watch mechanism

      2. Smith implements across commands

      3. Trainman verifies cross-platform behavior'
