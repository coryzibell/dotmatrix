    title: Structure data at source with YAML frontmatter
    body: "# Structure data at source with YAML frontmatter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Construct\
      \ review of `matrix` project. Spoon reframed the problem during perspectives\
      \ phase.\n\n**Source:** Spoon's reframing\n\n## Problem\n\nMatrix has 24 parsers\
      \ for 24 commands, each extracting data from markdown files in different ways.\
      \ This is the assumption that created complexity.\n\n## Reframe\n\nWhat if the\
      \ data was structured at the source?\n\nIf RAM files used YAML frontmatter,\
      \ one query engine could replace 24 parsers:\n\n```markdown\n---\nidentity:\

      \ deus]\ncreated: 2025-11-26\n---\n\n# Task content here...\n```\n\nThen commands\
      \ become queries:\n- `matrix velocity` \u2192 query frontmatter for status fields\n\
      - `matrix tension-map` \u2192 query for conflicting tags\n- `matrix garden-paths`\
      \ \u2192 query mentions field\n\n## Questions to Consider\n\n- Is this solving\
      \ the right problem?\n- Would structured frontmatter feel bureaucratic?\n- Does\
      \ the freeform nature of RAM files have value?\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n\
      1. Define frontmatter schema\n2. Update RAM file templates (garden-seeds)\n\
      3. Build unified query engine\n4. Migrate existing commands to use queries\n\
      5. Deprecate individual parsers\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Frontmatter\
      \ schema defined\n- [ ] Query engine handles all current command needs\n- [\
