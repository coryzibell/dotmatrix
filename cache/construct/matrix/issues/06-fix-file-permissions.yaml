    body: '# Fix file permissions from 0644 to 0600







      From Construct review of `matrix` project. Cypher identified minor security
      issue during security audit.


      **Source:** Cypher''s security audit


      ## Problem


      Files written by matrix use permissions `0644` (world-readable). Since these
      files may contain sensitive information in `~/.claude/ram/`, they should be
      `0600` (owner-only).


      ## Solution


      Change all `os.WriteFile` and file creation calls to use `0600` permissions.


      ## Implementation Steps


      1. Grep for all `0644` in codebase

      2. Change to `0600`

      3. Verify file creation still works

      4. Check no tests depend on specific permissions


      ## Acceptance Criteria


      - [ ] All new files created with `0600` permissions

      - [ ] No `0644` permissions in codebase

      - [ ] Tests pass

      - [ ] Existing functionality unchanged


      ## Handoff


      1. Smith makes the change

      2. Deus verifies tests pass

      3. Neo reviews and merges'
